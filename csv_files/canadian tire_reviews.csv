1,If I could give 0 stars I would. Arrived to my tire change appointment to learn that the mechanic did not feel like coming in today. Instead of calling us they simply cancelled our appointment. We showed up and they were no help to try to resolve the situation. Do not recommend this location.,Emma Rose Cheetham,2023-06-03
1,"Poor client service and critical lack of professionalism. I strongly support healthy workplaces where employees can talk to each other on the job and have a few laughs. It makes the atmosphere feel alive. But, when employees do the bare minimum, don't follow up with a call to a colleague for a client just to carry their discussions on as quickly as possible, it makes the experience drastically different and non-enjoyable. At the very least, CT, make sure all of your products can be located with the app because some are on shelves, but not indicated there. That way, I can do my thing and not have to chase after help from an employee.",Ahmed J. Magdoul,2023-04-29
1,"Horrible staff. PERIOD. Booked an appointment 2 weeks prior, I came to the appointment date and got told to come back the day after due to rescheduling issues. No notification no calls no texts to confirm. Staff didn’t care and was very rude!

Came the next day, gave my car for tire change. Staff told me come back in two hours. Car still not ready after 3 hours!!!! Does it really take 3 hours for a tire change?

Better find another garage for your car needs. They don’t care! And whoever hired them needs a big gold medal!",Nicolin Morais,2023-04-25

Related to MARK (MANAGER IN GARAGE)

Firstly i went there to buy new tires, also did wheel balancing and tire alignment,

Right after that my car started making weird issue which was very dangerous, When i drive my car on highway and go around 90-100 kmph speed , it suddenly makes noise and turn to right side about an inch - 2inch and it lasted 1 week.

I asked my friend and the other garage where i bought my car from, they said its happening because the wheel balancing/ alignment is not done properly.

I went to canadian tire again for that case they fixed my issue and you know what? Even i paid around $1200 for the first time for new tires and alignment+ balancing, they never did that. When i went to second time, they did it.   And the same day they said my wheel's 1 stud has been damaged and i need to change it which may cost me around $250-300 according to them i said no. ((They even didn't realized at first time)

After that my car started weird noise from exhaust right after a week like maybe THEY(CANADIAN TIRE) did something to make money..

I went there and asked for complete inspection of my car, i paid. $149 and they said i need to replace FLEX PIPE, SUBFRAME, LIGHT ,SPARK PLUG, etc... I do have my bills.  (( My car was perfect without any engine light))

I said yes to be sure that my car will be fine. They charged me around $2400 to replace everything... They also kept my car for 2 days continuous and MARK (supervisor) said our technician fixed your car without taking break.. LOL.. you know what?

When i picked my car and just drove 1 min away from garage, i felt the same exhaust farting noise, car shaking plus burning smell from engine plus the ENGINE LIGHT CAME UP FOR THE FIRST TIME. ((( Even i paid around $2400 to them to replace))

Another morning i went there which was Saturday, i met gabriel and he said i need to come on monday because they dont have technician even i saw one ..

I came on monday and MARK SAID ,' i know technicians changed the part but we will fix it for you.. (( that was 2nd time where i had to go after they fixed my car and paid full amount)) they dont check what their technician do and customer had to come 2 or 3 times to fix the issue.

This is not the end..

They fixed my car and i went to home, another morning i saw my engine light came up.. i went there straight they said they will fix it.. the same evening i got my car and engine light was fixed...

The next day i saw engine light came up again,, even they fixed 3 timesss..!  And even my Exaust was making minor noise.

I had to go again and to fix minor noise and engine light and they said that I WILL NEED TO REPLACE MANIFOLD ... !! Seriously? My car was perfect before giving to them and i pad around $4000 in total to do everything from tires to all replacement
.

I told them that this is not my car's fault. It is done by you and i was requesting them continue like 1 week to solve it without any charge, MARK said they will charge me very normal price ((i know its not my fault)) i said how much? He said he will need to check and get back to me..
After 3 days i made calls to them to check and 4th day he called me and said they will charge me around $1500 for the part price..

I said i have no money everything was done by you and now i would like to do it without any charge because i know it was not happening before.

MY MISTAKE THAT I WENT TO GET TIRES WITH THEM AND DID ALL REPLACEMENT WORK WITH THEM.. THEY DONT CARE!",Nigam shah,2023-06-22
3,This Canadian Tire need to be refreshed and cleaned. It is a big place with much dust everywhere... Difficult to breath... There is no the same variety of merchandise than other CT. Definitely few things to improve in this CT... :(,Guillermo Barrios,2023-04-11
