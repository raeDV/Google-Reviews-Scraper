1,Skylar Massicotte,5,2023-06-21,Was a 5 year student here and despite getting in situations with particular teachers the school is a great school! The staff are professional and understanding as well as the student programs diverse and set! I will never forget my student years at Vanier college thank you for the great memories 👨🏻‍🎓🎉 …,
2,Lawrence Kelly,1,2023-03-07,"Disappointing. Tried to register for courses at this school.  Could not get any assistance or direction by phone, email, or chat. Attempted multiple times.  Very strange that they had no interest in new students. Appeared like I was a chore, no one wanted to deal with.  Simplest of questions were unable to be answered by anyone. Consistently brushed off.  Very odd behaviour for a school. Obviously they have too many students already.",
3,Tina Bao-Han Nguyen,5,2023-04-06,"The college was very clean and organized. I love the environment at Vanier. The library was huge. I went to the library often to study there; it was incredible. I saw many students studying at the library and also they were very loud over there. One of the professors at Vanier told them to be quiet so that others can concentrate on their work. One of the counselors at Vanier was very friendly to help me to grow my potential. Overall, I enjoy attending Vanier College to study at the library. Hopefully, Vanier is the right college for me and would like to get my DEC over there. Wish me luck in my future!",
4,Alex Sylvester,4,2019-07-06,"As an istitution it's great! Provides above the basics but can be better in a lot of services. However, I have met a lot of people and it's a great place to learn at. The library has been recently renovated and it's amazing!",
5,ErisWhistles,3,2023-02-05,"Some teachers are excellent some teachers are awful in computer science.

The Access Center and Student services are good and offer a lot of nice help.

Biggest issue. parking. Students outnumber teachers by nearly 15 to 1. They closed the parking behind the park, they are monitoring parking more frequently I got a 68$ ticket for being in a free parking zone by the metro because the fee is 9$ a day at school parking if you are lucky to even get one. 6000 students in Vanier and maybe 100 spots for students.",
6,ND Tung,3,2023-02-05,"So far, it's a decent college in general. But the course registration system is truly a mess. I have to take a mountain biking for my PE course, which I don't know bike but it is the only available PE course that fit my schedule. Even the preference course change days come and my only option is mountain biking. Asked the academic advisor to help me find another course, ""Take it or delete it, I have a lot of work to do."" Imagine paying forcing a student to pay thousands for tuition and $260 for a course which he doesn't want to take but have no other choice. Now I have to do PE in summer course. This school really know how to exploit students' money.",
7,maryam farokhmehr,5,2021-07-05,"This college is one of the two English language colleges in Montreal they are respectful and the admission office is very very kind and helpful they try to tell you and guide you through all the admission steps you can also go to the campus and check the every Department computer science department department has around 3 or 4 computer Laboratories but today that I was there there was almost nobody there the professor is also staying at home they don't come to college so it looks like a graveyard. Silent and secluded. 😆😅
The campus is very nice and sweet. The bulding looks very old. But they have renovated them. The programs that are offered here in IT are general and not really specific.",
8,Amani Unknown,1,2023-03-07,"I went to the academic advising office today to get help about either cancelling a class or changing it, the guy (Marco) was not helpful at all, did not let me speak, and told me to hurry up to make my decisions and was super rude. He seemed like he didn’t even know what he was talking about and basically told me to « shut up » and make my decision. I left the office crying, and told the receptionist about it, which she responded with « Okay ». They pretend like they care but the staff is not professional and human at all. What an awful experience for a department that’s supposed to listen and help students.",
9,Alex Vanier,1,2023-04-06,Terrible school. All they care about is money and not about the quality of the education or teachers. They hire anyone with lack of experience and dont know how to teach at all!,
10,Keywan Hodaei Esfahani,3,2022-12-07,I go to Vanier for kids swimming lessons. This place is relatively clean. The swim instructors are capable and friendly. I have also played basketball here as part of a friendly tournament. Staff are friendly. The downside is lack of free parking.,
11,Judy Hung,5,2019-07-06,Excellent Steinway grand piano! Free & prepaid street & on campus parking!,
12,Lisa Kuhta,5,2022-12-07,Attended this school from 2002-2005 and it was by far the best years of my life! I did health science and most teachers were excellent! I really have fond memories! Thank you!,
