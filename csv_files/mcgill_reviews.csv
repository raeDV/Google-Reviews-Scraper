1,Terry Chu,5,2023-03-07,"One of the top universities in the world. Located by the hills of Mount Royal, the landmark of Montreal, McGill enjoys the advantages of mountain views as well as the convenience of downtown life. It’s located in the financial district. It’s amazing to see how many buildings are there in the campus. Students here are really smart and creative. It’s pleasant to be a student studying in this vibrant campus. Across from the campus main entrance, there is a wonderful church People’s church for students and faculties to enjoy Christian life and fellowship.",
2,Ryder B.,4,2023-06-07,"Gorgeous campus. Each building has its own unique character to it. I did my undergrad here and had an amazing experience. I met many great people from different walks of life. It is definitely a rigorous academic environment but I was pleased to see that professors were always available and willing to help (at least in my Faculty). Some of the classrooms are a bit small for the number of students in them and getting around the campus in the first year was tough, but you get used to it. The worst part is the climb up the Education hill. Unfortunately, the pathways on the campus are not salted properly during the winter months which can pose a challenge as you navigate between buildings. Most of McGill’s facilities are modern and welcoming and never had problems with administration. Excellent location too as it is downtown and many stores and restaurants nearby.",
3,Naomi Braude,5,2023-06-05,"Great university! So proud to have received my degree from such a prestigious university, in the most beautiful city in North America. McGill educates some of the kindest, most hard-working students. The faculty are amazing. I miss my days at McGill. The Canadian education system is world-class!",
4,Kent Zheng,5,2022-09-08,"Very cool university! Perfect location. Classic-looking buildings with modern equipment inside. Visited a chemistry lab - nicely organized. Also the book store is good, bought a couple souvenirs. Parking is expensive tho on Rue University.",
5,Jessica Sun,5,2022-07-05,"The campus is so gorgeous, especially on a sunny day! We came on a Sunday so a lot of the buildings were closed, but we were still able to enjoy the architecture from the outside, as well as take a look in the Redpath Library.",
6,Benyamin Feghhi,4,2023-06-05,"Been a student for a while and I can say they do accommodate for travel within campus even in winter when it’s the most slippery due to snow. However, there is no reason why any body would come here for a walk or cycling. It’s not really a park or a tourist attraction. If you want to walk( walk in saint Catherine). If you want to cycle( cycle in Maisoneuf). If you come because your asked to, It is a pleasant place and you wouldn’t be bother with being technically in an institution.",

Room for rent, bed, and breakfast type hospitality.

The GRAVITY Offering and introduces great Southern hospitality from ATLANTA, GA in The Congo Kinshasa",
8,Luis Daniel,3,2022-09-08,Nice University but its way too cold in Montreal most of the year to enjoy yourself and have fun. As a result most kids end up staying indoors too much. There is something off with this university despite it being called the Harvard of Canada.,
9,Vee Dinh,4,2021-07-05,"This school is huge and beautiful. It was so enjoyable walking around the campus. There was not a lot students when I visited but sometimes, there were still students running to class or biking around. So photogenic at the same time.",
10,Vikram Karandikar,5,2020-07-05,must visit in Montreal. Do visit the museum which is right inside the university campus and it's free but give some (voluntary) donations to keep it running. museum easily takes 2 hours to see all the exhibits. very clean campus.,
