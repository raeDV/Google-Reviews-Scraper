5,"Love this university. It has such a beautiful campus. Many of the professors are fantastic. Wish there was a few more resources offered to the Arts as the focus has been on Engineering.

There are two gyms (one of which is used for convocation) that include a swimming pool and skating rink, two big libraries, many parking lots, at least 5 Tim Hortons', and countless geese.

There is always something going on here and the atmosphere is great for learning and innovation. Often see the president walking through campus and there are always new buildings or other additions popping up throughout campus as it eternally seems to expand!

Lots of places to park but it can get quite busy if there are many events going on. Gets a little quieter during the summer as less students are enrolled for the spring term.

Many residence options for first years, upper years, grad students, and even families. Though it is a large campus everything is in walking distance and it is like its own little village.",Marta Borowska,2019-03-27
