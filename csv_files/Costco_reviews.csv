4,Wonderful place to buy most of the things. It would be great if there is a way to understand about everyday gas price and some limited time offer in wear-house.,Ehsan Moon,2022-12-12
4,"Just like any other Costco stores. Except this one is a bit small, but it can do. A very busy place located in busy business district in Ville St Laurent.",Omar Kuzbari,2023-03-04
3,"Choatic place with great variety of merchandise, quality food, great sales, the best food corner (small restaurant) inside for a quick eating if your hungry on your way out!

There parking spaces are the worst. Dangerous zones in front of the store to cross from the parking lot through the pedestrian space (no pedestrian safety) to the front store & the worst traffic area for cars.

My anxiety is always at a high peek level when driving there due to the high risk of someone potentially getting hit/hurt by car (pedestrians or not)🥵😵‍💫😨",Marie D.,2023-06-27
2,I like cosco and I’ve been going there for over 10 years. This is the first time a cashier screamed at me for no reason. She had an attitude from the beginning. It doesn’t make sense. « marine darline » is the name on my receipt. She has braids. I Hope you’ll train her a bit about the importance of customer service,Maimouna Sylla,2023-04-20
