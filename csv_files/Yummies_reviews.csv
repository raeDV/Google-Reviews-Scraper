1,Scottie ‚ÄúScot‚Äù Weatherup,3,2022-07-04,"Ok place. Ordinary kosher fast food. There are other places around with better taste.  Although there is a TV with the menu and pricing on it , the prices they charge are much higher than shown on TV. Why not update it eventually ?",Sorry to hear that it‚Äôs Ordinary for you and as for the price yes it‚Äôs a bit higher than the menu we are working on it thank you
2,Daniel Shahrabani,4,2022-07-04,"Very pleasant experience, the food was excellent and the location was very clean. The service was warm and friendly, and would like to go back to try other menu items. My only comment is that I wish the place would have more salad options.",
3,Ray Haley,1,2022-08-08,Very dissatisfied and disappointed. The Malawach was very small and bland. The Tunisian sandwich was horrible and they didn‚Äôt rap it properly so when I took it out of the bag it completely fell apart. Don‚Äôt recommend this place.,Sorry to hear that but you know sometime the Uber come with a bicycle maybe that‚Äôs why next time come to eat inside the restaurant for free of charge
