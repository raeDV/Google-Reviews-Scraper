5,"Very cool university! Perfect location. Classic-looking buildings with modern equipment inside. Visited a chemistry lab - nicely organized. Also the book store is good, bought a couple souvenirs. Parking is expensive tho on Rue University.",Kent Zheng,2022-08-17
5,"The campus is so gorgeous, especially on a sunny day! We came on a Sunday so a lot of the buildings were closed, but we were still able to enjoy the architecture from the outside, as well as take a look in the Redpath Library.",Jessica Sun,2022-05-30
3,Nice University but its way too cold in Montreal most of the year to enjoy yourself and have fun. As a result most kids end up staying indoors too much. There is something off with this university despite it being called the Harvard of Canada.,Luis Daniel,2022-08-07
4,"Gorgeous campus. Each building has its own unique character to it. I did my undergrad here and had an amazing experience. I met many great people from different walks of life. It is definitely a rigorous academic environment but I was pleased to see that professors were always available and willing to help (at least in my Faculty). Some of the classrooms are a bit small for the number of students in them and getting around the campus in the first year was tough, but you get used to it. The worst part is the climb up the Education hill. Unfortunately, the pathways on the campus are not salted properly during the winter months which can pose a challenge as you navigate between buildings. Most of McGillâ€™s facilities are modern and welcoming and never had problems with administration. Excellent location too as it is downtown and many stores and restaurants nearby.",Ryder B.,2023-06-06
5,"Great university! So proud to have received my degree from such a prestigious university, in the most beautiful city in North America. McGill educates some of the kindest, most hard-working students. The faculty are amazing. I miss my days at McGill. The Canadian education system is world-class!",Naomi Braude,2023-06-01
