i. Choose an appropriate framework for developing the user interface based on
requirements, such as PyQt, Tkinter, or Flask. </br>

#### b. User-Friendly Design:
i. Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. </br>
ii. Provide clear instructions and labels for input fields and buttons. </br>

#### c. Progress Indicators:
i. Display loading bars, spinners, or progress percentages to indicate the progress of
the scraping process. </br>

#### d. Error Handling:
i. Display user-friendly error messages when inputs are invalid or when the scraper
encounters issues. </br>

#### e. Responsiveness: 
i. Ensure the user interface is responsive and provides timely feedback during the
scraping process. </br>
