1,5,Was a 5 year student here and despite getting in situations with particular teachers the school is a great school! The staff are professional and understanding as well as the student programs diverse and set! I will never forget my student years at Vanier college thank you for the great memories 👨🏻‍🎓🎉,Skylar Massicotte,2023-06-19
2,1,Disappointing. Tried to register for courses at this school.  Could not get any assistance or direction by phone, email, or chat. Attempted multiple times.  Very strange that they had no interest in new students. Appeared like I was a chore, no one wanted to deal with.  Simplest of questions were unable to be answered by anyone. Consistently brushed off.  Very odd behaviour for a school. Obviously they have too many students already.,Lawrence Kelly,2023-02-09
3,5,The college was very clean and organized. I love the environment at Vanier. The library was huge. I went to the library often to study there; it was incredible. I saw many students studying at the library and also they were very loud over there. One of the professors at Vanier told them to be quiet so that others can concentrate on their work. One of the counselors at Vanier was very friendly to help me to grow my potential. Overall, I enjoy attending Vanier College to study at the library. Hopefully, Vanier is the right college for me and would like to get my DEC over there. Wish me luck in my future!,Tina Bao-Han Nguyen,2023-03-18
4,4,As an istitution it's great! Provides above the basics but can be better in a lot of services. However, I have met a lot of people and it's a great place to learn at. The library has been recently renovated and it's amazing!,Alex Sylvester,2019-05-10
5,3,Some teachers are excellent some teachers are awful in computer science.  The Access Center and Student services are good and offer a lot of nice help.  Biggest issue. parking. Students outnumber teachers by nearly 15 to 1. They closed the parking behind the park, they are monitoring parking more frequently I got a 68$ ticket for being in a free parking zone by the metro because the fee is 9$ a day at school parking if you are lucky to even get one. 6000 students in Vanier and maybe 100 spots for students.,ErisWhistles,2023-02-01
