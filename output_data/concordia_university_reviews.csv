1,Et si,5,2023-04-29,"Great uni! Great profs (not all of them as in every uni), great opportunities. Still a young university but has a lot of potential and can compete with the best unis in Canada in several fields (business, cs etc…).",
2,A,1,2023-05-29,"Coming from mcgill …. Concordia has no advisor… they say they do but they are impossible to reach and once you reach them they refer you to the online systems…… and are of no help

They barely have online courses…I took one 1.5 credit online this summer but has a mandatory 1 h per week in class…. So I have to drive 300km for that 1 h period every week.   ….. they would need to redefine online…

No help whatsoever for students and they are impossible to reason!",
3,JE Jean,1,2023-01-29,"As a student in the early 2000’s this was a great place to study. As a recent employee, my experience was terrible. I worked for the faculty of engineering and the people they have managing the staff are pathetic. They like to throw around all the buzz words that make it seem like they care about staff but they’re two-faced, shameless liars. The union is useless- they say « we know the management is underhanded but there’s nothing we can do » and the Academics in charge couldn’t care less. Worst management I’ve seen in my extensive experience in the workforce. My advice is: don’t leave a job to work in the engineering department.",
4,Bikram Lehar,1,2023-01-29,i have completed my masters and the only positive thing about the university is access to library and udemy courses rest is all worthless. so i spent 40 k in 1.5 years but it will help me getting a 3 year pgwork permit and 15 more points to my crs score. Thats it. not worth the time or money. Bad deal,

6,Valiri Saati,2,2023-01-29,"People deserve to know about how leftist radicals and conservative extremists are mishandling our public schools (Student union rigged elections, Marxism, fascism, Satanism through the Freemasons and Illuminati) Centrism could boost this 2-3 star school to a 4 or 5 star as the hidden curriculum within caused by corruption is hurting a lot of students. You could thug through in less politicized programs such as engineering but the point is that all programs should be under strict reform and ready to adapt international norms regarding Centrism like Russia, that is excelling at mixing science and religion together validly. Take for instance the political line. Since it takes into account all logic, therefore Centrism is part of that in the center and has validity as well as a lot of value and divine knowledge.",

Generally  Disorganized university specially for Biochemistry at Loyola camps,Bad schedules that ends late at night like night schools.(How student can study and graduated ??

How students handle bad time at night specially for the (Lab).
I have been in concordia since 2019 at loyola Camps I rarely find morning labs, which makes it hard to study since  I start early then back late to home for
Fall semester 2023  (horrible).
Lab should be at morning time ,than Evening time.Isnt' logical at all ,to finish night at 10 .pm, arrive home 11.30 p.m.
Hope we get solation soon😥😥😥 Not recommended  0 star",
16,79 EDM,3,2022-11-30,"Concordia University is an indifferent university. It depends on you, if you like this university and if it’s meant for you, the student and employee.

During the pandemic, it is hard to study online and do  a Hybrid style year.  For those on leave or absence, use this time to not enroll until this COVID-19 pandemic ends.

Firstly, some of the staff, professors and other members are friendly, kind, sweet and genuine. While others are the opposite. So it depends who you want, what to expect from the professor and vice versa.

They should have better services for students of all backgrounds. I feel the quality of services I am getting are not that beneficial to me since it was not mentioned or promoted enough. I do hope services will improve for all.

Their downtown campus is not that environmental friendly. Loyola is the greenest campus they have. They should plant more trees, add green spaces, make it carbon negative and pollution free of possible. Also turn into a Zero Waste and a environmentally sustainable campus since they are on their way to Carbon Free by 2050 although that year is too soon too late. They should make it to 2030-2035 at the latest.

The University feels rundowned. Almost everything is breaking apart. They need to renovate  the downtown school buildings because I feel that they need to update to today's century and it just feels better.

If they renovate it  feels like a better atmosphere  a better learning experience and it seems more inviting as well. As for now, Most of their buildings are crumbling and slowly going downhill like a glacier. They need to clean  the buildings and improve it A.S.A.P.

Students should also take care of the university because it’s our school as well and we need to help and maintain it so that it will be a good school.

One benefit of the school is the Webster library. It's probably one of the simplistic and beautiful libraries I have ever been in. The layout and floor plan is well thought out.

Also, it is located near the Metro which is ideal for proximity.

Most students who could not get into McGill come here to pursue their studies here and most students know that they have different programs that you can't find at McGill.

This school should be a private univeristy without any government support or subsidies since it would be better and we get better services. Plus since it would be better Private it  can make sure all students a get the help they need without government support.

Also it should be like McGill and UdeM where they have green spaces and better learning opportunities and programs for students that want to make Concordia University their choice.

Yes Concordia is a great University but they need to improve if they want to be the best in the city and in the world. They should continue to push and make the effort to be in the top 100 at least. I hope they make it in the top 200. That would be a great feat if they can pull it off.

As for English it is important and a lot of students from French institutions also come here as well to learn the language and vice versa. Many French students I know love this university and many international students as well.

I hope they improve and change the learning curriculum for future generations. There will be a lot challenges ahead but hopefully they will change for the better.

At the end of the day, all current and future staff, personnel and students should be polite and nice towards others and themselves now and in the future to make the world a better place with the education and services from Concordia University.",
17,Haroon Chaudhry,5,2022-06-28,"I visited Concordia as a prospective student from the United Kingdom. I never had the pleasure to pursue my studies there but what made me really reach out and review was due to the experience I had when I was researching. I visited the campus in the middle of the city, and was provided with all the information from the reception. I was also introduced to a lecturer and she was also very kind in giving her time to explain what was on offer and how the university was different to the others in the area.

I would definitely recommend this institution as just this small experience was enough for me to make my mind up.",
18,Helene Lemieux,1,2022-06-28,"I’m introverted and I keep my private life outside of school, but I happen to be victim homophobia by a peer and the school didn’t do anything. I was forced to do teamwork with that said student for an entire semester, and ended up having to do it all by myself, because the person couldn’t talk to me for religious reasons. Many students there are clueless. I was one of 2 students to pass a calculus class with an A+, the average was D. You won’t learn much, and you’ll waste time around stupid people. Don’t get too excited if you get accepted to Concordia, they accept basically everyone as long as you have the money. Go to McGill if you’re serious about studying. Or become an entrepreneur and forget about university, they’re all run like businesses anyways.",

Couches, seats, benches, huddle bubbles, colourful place, with fantastic lighting. Haven't been in a while though. Not sure if it is open to the public in these times so I'd call ahead.",
24,Kai Sun Chan,4,2022-10-31,Concordia University is one of the four universities in Montreal. It is an English language institution of higher learning. It is one of the youngest universities in Canada. The commerce and engineering programs are one of the best in Canada.,
25,Perry,2,2021-06-28,"I was graduated last year in Concordia in the program of master of Building engineering. I passed 11 main courses. I only had one or two professor whom you could call them professor. The rest were awfully ineligible of teaching as a master professor. This department had a many issues and nobody was responsive. We had a lot of so called professors who they could not speak English fluently let alone their technical knowledge. We had several issues with professors in terms of materials and gradings. We took some of these issues to the chair and the head of the department but they unprofessionally ignored us by not even responding our emails or by telling us that it is the professor who decides although they had always promised us to help and take part in any concern or issue that we encounter.
I have heard from many people that in the department of engineering you will feel that there are a lot of favoritism acts in selecting the employees and their behaviors against students. I guess that is the major problem, and unfortunately, it is going to ruin the reputation of this department and this university.
I wish I had achieved something out of the 2 year program and the large amount of money I spent on it.",
26,Ogy Zlatev,1,2022-06-28,"Run, if you can. A lot of ""professors"" are just collecting a paycheck who barely speak English and don't actually know the material thus making a bunch of mistakes and therefore teaching you the wrong thing. Concordia will hire just about anyone. The administrative services are completely mismanaged and outdated. I hate to say this but I am embarrassed to go here and would go elsewhere if my program was offered in English, which is ironic because so many of the professors barely speak it. For 400$/course, or 2000$/course for international students, Concordia University is not in the business of teaching but in the business of spending little and having students return and pay for the class again. It is legal robbery. Very shameful.",

The school's courses are practically all unavailable (especially if you're trying to fulfill your non-JMSB requirements),

90% of my midterms have been on a Sunday, and overlapping with each other

I have had nothing but problems with the administration, and

In my critical thinking class, I got penalized for not repeating the textbook verbatim...

I study mechanical engineering here and it seems like very few professors care about the mental state of their students. The workload this semester compared to previous semesters is not manageable and induces high levels of pressure on the students with constant deadlines. You will be constantly working and yet will always be behind somehow! I have no social life this semester whatsoever not because of the pandemic but because I spend my entire days working on those damn lab reports. If you do choose to enrol take as many of Dr. Hany Gomaa's classes, he is truly a remarkable professor.",
33,Sebastian Snow,1,2022-06-28,A lot of full time students will have to wait an extra year plus to graduate because key credit classes are booked solid for lack of staff.

This is a joke compared to how universities deal with future students here in the US.

49,Carl Fournier,3,2013-06-30,"I went to Concordia University from 1993 to 2001. I got two degrees: BA (Honours) and MA, both in History. My undergraduate experience was very good as I exposed myself to a general History program in terms of geography and time period. There were certain difficulties that I experienced which I will not go into detail here. Suffice it to say my academic and extra-academic activities were very enjoyable and very memorable.
My graduate experience was fair to good. I had an opportunity to sample the academic life without any pleasures or rewards associated with it. The problem was that the Concordia History Department was in the process of transition, and change is not always smooth or trouble free. In addition it was the free reign of PC in all its ugly and unattractive manifestations. I have to say that I sympathize with the goals and aims of the PC movement: tolerance, inclusion, acceptance of all within the university community. I disagreed and still do with the methodology and underlying assumptions of PC, namely speech and behaviour codes. Moreover I lost my father part way through the research for my MA thesis, which illustrated to me if nothing else the strange new world the PC crowd were trying to create.
It has now been over 11 years since I graduated from Concordia with two degrees in hand and ready to take my leap into the world. It hasn't been entirely successful, but that is more my doing and the state of the world than anything else. I still remember my thesis supervisor, Dr. Frank Chalk, with respect and fondness. Certain other professors touched my life either lightly or heavily, but all of them are remembered one way or another.
I would recommend Concordia to anyone planning to go to university. I would do so with a word of warning: make sure you know what it is you want in university and then just do it! Thanks for your time!",

Their faculty staff especially in the Fine Arts of which Ms Duclos is the dean,is so disrespectful to applicants , it's astounding. Art studies used to have a strong ,respectful community, but not anymore. Student counseling in general at Concordia is lacklustre, they seem to not really care about assisting students but more about 'politics' and image.
Some of the staff are evasive/condescending and teachers are disengaged with their pupils . Aside from this their website for admissions is bugged /crashing & poorly designed. But of course if anything goes wrong its your fault.They have a god complex I imagine. When I find something good about it, will add it to this review.",

57,Simon Jacques,3,2017-06-29,"Let's start by stating that I've been doing my bachelor's degree at Concordia for the past 2 years in Computer Science.

People often say that teachers are crazy but that's going a bit over the limit. Sure not all teachers are great but neither are all students. I've personally met some of my best teachers at Concordia (Aiman Latif Hanna is a good example). Teachers like these compensate for all the bad ones you will meet. Some people also tend to exagerate a teacher's lack of teaching skills simply because they have a hard time with the class and aren't bothered to study. The key to success is not only having a great teacher but also being a great student.

That being said, the reason why I remove 2 stars is because of the shady activities happening behind the scene at Concordia. Bureaucracy there is complete and utter garbage. The information system has been very poorly designed, untested, and clearly overpaid for. Budget cuts for teaching assistants, maintenance of classrooms, and overall cleaning are making the experience miserable, or even unbearable sometimes.

Luckily, the student base at Concordia is awesome.  You get to meet all kinds of people from different corners of the globe, and you get to work with (mostly) dedicated students.

It is expensive but I think that's a standard for every University.

I recommend if for engineering and business degrees in English, especially if you don't like McGill's crowd.",

Outside of faculty teachers and classes are much better, eg. JMSB teachers/classes, easily get a B+, without much effort but; 1. attend the classes, 2. listen and 3. do the work assigned, which isnt even that hard to accomplish.

I was a student at CCE in CEFR 625. I have done almost every test, but I did miss the last one due to personal reasons. Yesterday I have asked CCE to arrange a delayed test for me, but got a reply this morning saying I have to re-register CEFR 625 to get the certficate.

I am deeply disappointed about CCE. Only one last test was missed and now I have to re-do the whole thing. This is exactly the oppposite of
@Concordia's motto.
