1,G Xg,5,2023-04-30,"Pros: nice interior, medium to large size compared to other public libraries of municipality level of Montreal

Cons: the noise level is a bit high compared to other smaller libraries and Westmount public library, opening hours are short given its size",
2,Viktoriya M,5,2019-06-30,"Very good place. The staff in really friendly  and helpful. A lot of activities that are offered for free, very good installations. The kids area is well designed and divided into sections. The adult section is on top floor, which makes it quite. It has French and English books and lots of computers in both sections. You can watch films there. It has the cultural center which offers free spectacles and presentations. Kids love to visit this library.",
3,Mélanie LB,4,2020-06-29,"Very big public library. The inside space is really amazing. You have access to different sections with a very well designed kids corner.

The work/study rooms that you can reserve are great and keep you from the possible noise or chatter. Great system.",
4,alex toutongi,2,2018-06-30,"the new location is nicer and more spacious than its previous counterpart, although i find the architecture ugly. Staff are polite and helpful, pretty decent selection of books to choose from. WiFi is really slow so if you really heavily on the internet for study, this ain't the place for you. The noise level is crazy by library standards, lots of kids making noise and it makes it difficult to concentrate overall for reading/studying. There are some private rooms to  study but i believe they are one reserve in advance.",
5,Ekaterine Chighladze,5,2019-06-30,Very friendly and helpful stuff.  My kids enjoy going there. It's a good place to read books and there are many free events here. It's opened on a Sunday. Very clean library  and good air conditioning. I often take my kids there to borrow new books to read.,
6,Omar Qureshi,5,2023-05-30,My local library. Very nice interior. Decent selection of nintendo switch games to borrow. I love it.,
7,Neil Williamson,5,2022-12-31,"Nice kids section, great staff. The Maker lab is incredible, I assumed my kid was too young at 6 but they patiently showed her how to design and 3D print her unicorn bunny. Amazing!",
8,Asia Rivera,5,2022-12-31,"I passed by the other day, and I was positively surprised. It’s a very welcoming space, I really like the halls and the way it’s designed. It’s cozy, people were very respectful. I liked my time there, even if it was just under half an hour.",
9,SHIYUE Z,5,2020-06-29,"yes, they have baby section, maybe noisy sometimes. but if u complaint this library is not good, I dont know where you could find other better than here.
PS: yes, other comments mentioned the staff here are not that helpful sometimes. It is ture or not, some staff really activity to help but some not. Winter time, baby activity sometimes cancelled at last minutes, but not informed to the parents. like this morning, almost 8 babies with their parents waiting outside in the cold for the baby activity. but the library not opened on time and ask one of the staff, she replied she has no idea about it....",
10,S.E. McKenzie,1,2022-06-29,"On the positive side: now in July you can book computers for yourself and return videos in automatic return chute. On the negative side: one of my latest experiences was disappointing. Got hassled twice by a man not respecting social distancing who wanted the computer I had booked, even when there were several empty computers available. It is too bad people in this postal code aren't treated with same respect as Westmount, IMO. People say it all the time but it is true  IMO. Don't act so surprised that we actually read and know how to use a computer and actually have university diplomas.

Not so user friendly for working & sometimes doesn't feel safe or that privacy/distance rights are being respected/taken seriously. Lots of gossiping and noise, IMO, probably not much concern for misinformation's harmful impact, IMO.

Library culture seems to create social distinctions.

Was a bit of  a culture shock, before Covid-19, when the red vested trendy looking security team were standing aound and sometimes watching from the stairs and just stared, sometimes they would tell someone off & made it harder to concentrate.

Loud gossiping feels almost like you are back in high school watching the cool kids wearing cool clothes and living with cool parents while looking down and tormenting those less fortunate who were about to age-out into homelessness, trapping them in self fulfilling prophecies, and increasing dropout rates, reinforcing their own unapproachable groupthink about them, IMO.

Like another poster described, you need to see the funny side, then errors won't feel so bad but why make errors about people in first place? Why allow gossip to be weaponized? Why lord social power over others? Why not treat adults like adults? Seriously what stops them from just handing out phone number or address with gossip they share?

Before many services were closed again:
At times still noisy cause of auditory design or lack of one, IMO. Giving people space and showing respect is far less intimidating than maskless hovering. Little kids' place is still not open so they can't be blamed for noise. Returns are placed under 24 hour quarantine.

Before Covid-19:
Could be a very nice library. Good selection of French movies.

If noise & privacy policies were fair & effective there would obviously be less noise & more privacy, IMO.

A list of answers to most Frequently Asked Questions could help many new people who won't be familiar with keyboard setup. Hints like: to access  the @ for email address  it is alt control @. Push shift or push Ctrl and then highlight the amount of time that you want to reserve on reservation schedule if you want to work for longer  than half an hour. You can eat in cultural centre lobby, which is complete with microwave & fridge. You can also borrow laptops & tablets to use inside library.

I recommend this library due to quantity of computers, laptops, tablets; not so much without these things to use. Experience could be disappointing due to noise and what sometimes feels like institutional discrimination causing discomfort/disadvantage for some but not for others. Don't drop out or quit, just let possible systemic disadvantage make you stronger the way it either makes or breaks you by design,  IMO. Laugh at it,  if you can.

At times can feel more like a daycare center than a library. Noisy, intrusive atmosphere could impact quality of your work. Doesn't always feel safe,  respectful or clean. The acoustical design of this building seems to be lacking & noise echoes & could weaken focus.

Huge difference between superficial goodness & actual goodness, which is why you are not supposed to judge a book by its cover. Get to know how everything works so you can solve most problems. Libraries are meant to serve a higher purpose & why they are supposed to be quiet and free from prejudicial vocals & ghetto traps where resistance feels futile, IMO. It is true that the hand holding the pen writes history. Sometimes male cleaner will start cleaning women's washrooms in attached cultural centre while you are still in there.",
11,Ziki KI,5,2022-06-29,"The library is a great place, calm, quite and a very pretty place. They even have computers and Tablets you can use all you need is a library card to access them. The bathrooms are extremely clean and a nice green color. The more mature books are upstairs, anywhere you turn there's a place to sit. It's more crowded during the weekends though",
12,Loida Pancorbo,4,2021-06-29,The building is modern and the space is open. Great collection for kids. They lend board games too and with the Nelligan system they will have in days the reservations that you did ready for you. You can autocheck out the books by yourself without interacting with anybody if you are shy.,
13,Anaam Embark,5,2023-04-30,I love the way that you could watch a movie on a tvq,
14,Andrew Sisk,5,2021-06-29,A beautiful space. Family friendly and full of spaces to sit and study or read. The graphic novel section is amazing. A toddler play space. Study rooms. Access to LEGO robotics kits. The tech lab is incredible. Highly recommend this space.,
15,Kim Hayes,5,2018-06-30,"Compared to the old location this is absolutely the best. The building is spacious, modern, welcoming, and there are many spaces to sit and relax. It can be very busy though with students studying and, unfortunately, young kids left running everywhere because parents think it's ok to allow it. Great selection of books, the staff is friendly, and I'm happy the Montreal libraries are getting more books online.",
16,Amanta Hf,5,2022-12-01,"Very good library, quiet and peaceful i go there from time to time",
17,Vanesa J,2,2021-06-29,"The place is really good. Looks like the new Library in Lachine. The person who talked to us wasn't very kind and was complaining about an error from other library in our file, trying to make me fill guilty as I was a child... Kind of funny, but not enjoyable, experience. We ll see if they improve the approach when they will fix the issue.",
18,Cynthia Marie,1,2017-06-30,"The library itself is wonderful and the staff is amazing and quite helpful. However, as happens so often nowadays, kids are running around, riding scooters, racing up and down the stairs and acting as though everything and everyone was put on the earth for their use and amusement.  You really can't relax and enjoy yourself. I just pick up my books and leave. It's too bad because it could be a nice place for everyone to enjoy but as it stands now it is not. It's a giant toy for kids to play in.  There is no one interested in asking kids to think about others. We are raising a generation who will lack compassion and never think about anyone but themselves. So sad.",
19,Casey Ecker,4,2021-06-29,Probably one of my favorite little libraries in all of Montreal. Lovely selection of everything from novels to fashion/history and language books. Incredibly kid friendly and fun activities like figure sketching with a live model.,
20,Louis Perron,5,2018-06-30,"Very cool library. Great place to work away an afternoon in any season. Definitely worth a visit. It’s also across from the park, so you can take out a book and go read on the grass. Love it!",
21,Maryam Nasr,4,2022-06-29,Very nice spacious library but closes too early. Kids want to go after school after dinner !!,
22,Coll,5,2022-12-01,One of the best libraries in the city. Huge collection of English books upstairs,

I wish they could extend the opening time which is really needed",
26,Julie Godon,5,2018-06-30,"This new neighbourhood library has everything, comfy and sunnny spaces to read, great classes like 3D printing. If you can't find your book, you can reserve it online with the Nelligan system - it will turn up in a few days and you will get notified by email.",
27,Olivia Popescu,5,2022-06-29,Love this library - always has the books I am looking for and it has lots of fun sitting areas.,

33,Tara Gerrie,1,2020-06-29,"Rude and incompetent staff.  In the dead of winter was told we had to wear our soaking wet boots in the library only to have to take them off in the kids section.

Kids section nothing to brag about.",
34,Tulip Tu,5,2019-06-30,"It’s a new library with modern convenience facilities. I can study here for all day ,most time it’s quite .The labtops and iPads are rentable ,it’s really good.",

38,R Bot,3,2018-06-30,"This library is not so friendly for those who are looking for a place to work. First is the schedule, the library is not accessible for those who work in the morning.  Second the reading tables don't offer any sort of isolation.",

La nouvelle bibliothèque Benny est un immense progrès physique et architectural par rapport à la chapelle étroite et vieillote d'avant. Cette fraîcheur nouvelle se remarque tout autant chez le personnel. Les ours(es) qui hantaient l'ancien local semble y avoir été  laissé(e)s. On ne croise plus à Benny que des employés aimables, doués d'un bon sens de l'humour et toujours prêts à rendre service avec le sourire. C'est un réel bonheur que d'aller bouquiner dans cet endroit.",

J'y trouve facilement ce dont j'ai besoin. Définitivement un endroit que j'adore!",
86,Martine Savard,1,2020-06-29,"L'endroit pourrait être vraiment très bien. Mais ici, comme c'est si souvent le cas, c'est l'enfant qui règne! Bref, on se sent bien plus au terrain de jeux que dans une bibliothèque. Quel dommage! :(",

Maintenant je suis obliger d'aller avec mon garçon à la bibliothèque pour pouvoir emprunter un jeux .(Sérieusement je vais porter plainte si ça continue comme ça .) Aller plutôt à la bibliothèque de la côte des neige la Au moin c'est beaucoup mieux,
