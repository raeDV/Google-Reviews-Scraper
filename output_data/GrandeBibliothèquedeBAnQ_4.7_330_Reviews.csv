1,Anonymous,5,2023-01-08,"Beautiful library architecturally and inspiring place to work. Tables all over but it gets rather busy so I'd suggest arriving around 9-10am. Comfortable desks too, has a slight angle to it and slight angle footrest too at the base. Airy and light, though can be noisy depending where you sit so bring some headphones. Bright and inspiring.

You can borrow video games too!",None
2,Krystel El Koussa,5,2023-04-08,"I love this library. It’s really big, beautiful and clean. They have a bistro and a café. You can get a membership card if you reside in Quebec and you can actually borrow anything from the library for free. You can also just come in and read in it for an afternoon. Do some research, study.",None
3,Caroline Malee,5,2023-05-08,"The most incredible library! We just wandered the sections and fell in love. It is so cool to see such a large collection of comics and graphic novels, and the music/record room was amazing! Architecturally lovely, it's airy and comfortable and feels inviting",None
4,C M,5,2022-09-10,"The most beautiful library in Montreal. I really love the music room on 5th floor. Staff are all friendly and so helpful! Location is also good, connects to the subway(I saw that the parking fee is around $12)",None
5,Barbara “Financial Tidbitter” Aboagye,4,2022-07-07,"This is a beautiful space to relax and work. It's open to the general public.  To borrow books, you do need to have a card. There are enough working space and computers to work with. You can also have a space for your laptop. It's quiet and I do love the ambiance. There are a wide variety of books to choose from.  There are video games which you can borrow as well as magazines and manga. The library has a wide variety of resources for kids and adults and all kinds of academic disciplines. There are elevators and easy to move from one floor to the other.

The architecture is surely impressive!",None
6,Emilia Guidobono,5,2022-07-07,"People, brace yourselves if you are bookworms! I lost myself here.

8,Nigel Peters,5,2022-07-07,"It was such a calm and reassuring library knowing that people are still reading in this modern technological age of Super computers and lightning fast internet.
Plenty of books in case you are wondering- fantastic collection of books for every reader.
There is a fast elevator to take you up and down the 4 floors.
Saw a lot of staff around and quiet areas where you could work.
Computers to for those who need then.
It's free to enter so anyone can. Parking is available outside and is metered - what a blessing in Montreal.
If you like reading go to this library.",None
9,SILVIA RAMIREZ,5,2023-06-23,"The biggest public library in Montreal. It has a bit of everything, comics, magazines, novels in braille or audio. Is a nice selection of books and documents open to everyone who enjoys learning, relaxing and reading.",None
10,Esther Gibbons (Wedding Photographer),5,2023-05-08,"Beautiful spacious library where you can work or study, in addition to borrowing books, board games, video games, movies etc. Many comfortable workspaces with laptop plugs readily available, although spots can fill up fast on busy days.

You can also borrow ebooks on your phone or tablet for free with the Libby app.

11,Cityguide,5,2023-05-08,"I absolutely love the Grande Bibliothèque de BanQ! This library is truly a gem in the heart of Montreal, offering a vast collection of books, journals, and multimedia resources in a wide variety of languages. The building itself is stunning, with a modern design that is both spacious and inviting.

What sets this library apart, however, is its exceptional customer service. The staff members are knowledgeable, friendly, and always willing to help you find what you're looking for. They also offer a range of programs and events for all ages, including workshops, book clubs, and author readings.

Whether you're a student, a researcher, or simply someone who loves to read, the Grande Bibliothèque de BanQ is a must-visit destination. It's the perfect place to spend a quiet afternoon browsing books or to dive deep into research on any topic. I highly recommend this library to anyone looking for a great resource in Montreal!",None

17,Osama Baig,5,2022-07-07,"This library is very well organized! I just wish they had a semi silent area for those that want to ""Work from home"" or be able to participate in work calls.

It's a little utilitarian and a bit run down in some spots, but it has a few nice little pockets if you want to get out of the house and get a bit of work done.  It's nothing to call home about, but a solid public library is a special place and will always be five stars in my book...",None

37,Hetal Sompura,5,2022-09-10,"Positives: Great selection for printed Books, video games, movies and Magazines. Usually helpful staff. Once Security personnel helped us with first aid as well.

Negatives: They do not have online access for Harvard Business review and other top magazine's latest copies. Many eBooks are not available. Once I met uncourteous staff, she seemed irritated by my question and having to answer in English (just one of the case)",None
38,S. M.,5,2022-07-07,"Huge and beautiful space; there’s a variety of materials available to borrow, including in English. I feel happier after walking into this library. Good service, though the self-serve machines are easy to use as well. The book return machine is also neat to watch.",None

40,stuckInTime,1,2022-07-07,"RUDE security guard. Asked a question politely and the security guard intimidated me and would not answer my question because I didn’t say Bonjour first. Unbelievable!!! I have been going to this library for 10 years and It has always been like a sanctuary to me. I have returned back to the city and went there just to be intimidated. I don’t feel like going there anymore!!!!
Security staff are supposed to make users of the library feel safe NOT intimidating innocent people. What a shame this guy is. He certainly doesn’t deserve being a security guard. This needs to be investigated. Incident happened on 21 June 2022 between 17hr30 to 18hr00. Totally unacceptable.",Hi! We’re sorry to read that your recent visit to the Grande Bibliothèque was not satisfactory. Rest assured that the necessary checks and reminders will be diligently carried out with the security guard in question. Libraries are indeed sanctuaries and we hope that this experience does not keep a long-time patron like you from coming back. Thank you and have a nice day!

44,Nikhil,5,2022-07-07,Huge multi level library. Very friendly staff. Millions of books. Non fiction section is amazing. Comics and children section is unsurpassable. Can't thank enough to Quebec government for making this a public library and accessible to all.,❤️

The only reason I am taking off a star is because the place always has few weirdoes here and there, tweaking and screaming randomly and that can be distracting. It is near Berri Uqam after all.",None

49,Sony L,5,2022-11-09,"Montreal is gifted with many good libraries (of which, I will always miss the old and historical Bibliothèque Centrale de Montréal on Sherbrooke Street), and Grande Bibliothèque de BAnQ is a reminder of how Montreal takes its libraries seriously: full range of timely information and services, clean, comfortable and spacious.",None
50,Sandy Nguyen,4,2021-07-07,"Absolutely gorgeous building! A very modern library if we talk about its architecture. The floor-to-ceiling windows allow natural sunlight to come through which add a homey vibe to it. However, I don't suggest you to study there since all floors are open and sounds resonate a lot (we can hear noise from the 1st floor all the way to the fourth floor) which can be distracting for people that needs silence. Nonetheless, great library!",None

Being that it is a library books are to be expected, but I'm continually amazed by the incredible selection of non-book items like films, documentaries, series, cartoons, comics of all kinds and even video games... Hell, there is even board games for kids in the kids floor. How cool is that?! The staff are also very helpful.

57,Lieven M,5,2021-07-07,"Anyone who lives in the City should absolutely visit this amazing masterpiece!! The architecture of this location inside and outside is gorgeous! The library has thousands of books of course, CDs, DVDs, and wait .. video games?!?! Yes it does.

The investment into this location can be compared to those at major universities in the US.

Si vous habitez MTL ou de passage, n’hésitez pas de visiter la Grande Bibliothèque! There’s a kids and toddlers space as well.

You can literally borrow up to 25 books for up to 3 weeks ... wait what?!?!

Alors abonnez-vous à BAnQ and enjoy this amazing ride!",None
58,Kos Saxon,5,2022-07-07,I love this library and the huge selection of books inside of it - the multilingual selection is on point. The online selection through the virtual portal is vastly helpful for those who prefer to use electronic access!,❤️
59,Alex,3,2021-07-07,"While it's called the grand library and it's supposed to have a lot of different spaces and facilities, there are very few spaces for studying or reading the books. There isn't enough new book titles, movies and music, they're at least a couple of years old. I thought it would be better than my university library in most of the aspects, but it's simply not.",None
60,Dennie Nguyen,5,2022-07-07,Most beautiful library and the staff there are helpful and kind. You need to visit at least once. They have a huge collections of all materials - every book that I've search up is always available to borrow. One of a kind library!,None
61,Smiae,5,2021-07-07,"Amazing selection of books, movies, video games, and journals. There's a good amount of materials that you would normally require a university library for. I also recommend signing out a travel guide from the library before travelling instead of buying your own.",None
62,Pat Laugh,3,2017-07-08,"Great place and very accessible!
However, there are 3 elevators, mostly used by lazy people, in practically constant use, making constant noise in most of the library (they had the ingenuity of putting them in the centre of the library), making reading quietly impossible in most of the library, really defeating a main purpose of a library. Either listen to music or walk far away from the elevators. They have many chairs and desk available -- you can still hear the noise, but it's less loud. The constant noise of the elevators is really a turn off for me, though. Why are people so lazy?? And why do they need THREE elevators, one somewhere discrete would've been well enough! And the door rings twice each time it opens, for even more noise! Because of this, I don't go study at this library, except when other, more quiet libraries are closed (like during the summer).

Grande Bibliothèque maintains its long hours throughout the year. But, it is closed on Mondays (why??). Another annoyance: they make a global announcement about the children's place closing (why not just make the announcement there instead of throughout the whole library?).

Also, on their online database, if it says a book is available, don't count on that, especially if it's a popular book! Books that not at their location (lost) are marked as available! So don't go expecting your book will be there!

Incredible architecture, and beautiful place, but with serious fundamental flaws.",None
63,Rachel Green,4,2021-07-07,"i love libraries, and this one has it all...usually. Covid has reduced it's cosy seating and café hours (actually, I'm not sure if the café is currently open), but you can borrow all the books, CDs and DVDs you've always eanted to read, hear and watch. the spaces have optimal  natural light and the staff is knowledgeable and helpful. it'll be back to 5 stars when all the services are reinstated.",None
64,Justin Anthony,5,2022-07-07,"Best library in town to study or just explore, friendly staff, and yay for the fact that it's air-conditioned during the summer and feels warm during the winter.

Just confused about the reviews about the lack of English books...you're either not looking enough or you're just entitled lol. Would you expect a Francophone to go to Edmonton, Fredericton or Vancouver and complain about the lack of French books in the library? Would you go to Germany and complain about why public libraries have more books in German than in English? Make it make sense",None
65,H Vaillancourt,3,2018-07-08,"Nice place, the architecture is amazing! The staff is always helpful and, if you speak French, there is a huge variety of books. However, the place is always crowded, sometimes it looks like a shopping mall and not a library. And if you are looking for books written in English... sigh... you are not at the right place. There are a few books in English but only old ones and no major work. I tried to find novels written by contemporary authors, but to no avail. The clerk told me that the target clientele of this library is French reading persons, even if it is the biggest library in the province.",None
66,Vile Meme,4,2017-07-08,"An excellent resource for research, with plenty of books, physical or numerical, magazines, newspapers and audiovisual content. There are some desks available for work and relatively comfortable seats for reading. You can also work in private rooms, which is useful for team projects. The library has plenty of computers available for use. However, my main annoyance with the library is the noise. The library tends to get crowded and the staff struggle to apply the rules. There are plenty of rude people who don't seem really concerned about silence which sometimes makes work or reading a pain in the ass. You also have the occasional homeless person sleeping in a chair. My suggestion? Borrow the things you need and work/read somewhere else.",None
67,Gabriel R. Rizzoli,5,2017-07-08,"I love this place. Yeah the sound of the elevators can be slightly distracting when you're reading, and the bathrooms could be vastly improved, still I'm so glad this place exists. It's modern, warm and inspiring. I notably enjoy the seats in the back. I stopped renting my films when realised i could get them for free here.",None
68,Paul Rebar,4,2018-07-08,"Great place to study and get work done!  Clean, modern, with decent wifi and lots of seating and outlets.  The catalogue is enormous in French and pretty good in English.  It can get a little crowded but there are usually plenty of free seats before noon.

The only downsides with this place are:

1) Closed on Mondays.  Kind of inconvenient for students, freelancers and remote workers who want to give themselves a standard workweek in a reliable location.  It's busy enough on the days it's open, after all.

2) There are a lot of drug addicts, homeless and mentally ill hanging around, which can get distracting and brings up questions of hygiene and theft.  I’ve witnessed more than one violent, shouty outburst and just the other day I saw a crusty old guy with his shirt off doing self-grooming in one of the chairs.  I’m not sure what the solution is, but I am sure a library should be peaceful and safe.

3) The centrally-located elevators are in constant use and ding loudly every time the doors open.  I assume this is to help the visually impaired, but a quieter signal would probably work just as well.  In many areas it's hard to concentrate without headphones.",None
69,Austin Graff,5,2020-07-07,"This is a library close to the university. It's often open late and HUGE! There are plenty of spaces to read, study, or even connect (quietly) with a friend. The design itself is beautiful with many levels and opportunities for the natural light to shine through.",None

I use to go here everyday and every book or movie I watched in English I found in French.(well almost all)   The library is super cool about ordering books, movies and music you want/need.  The wifi is fast the 4th floor is my favourite, it's the media section so you can watch films get movies and music watch it there or bring it home.   I discovered so much music I love.

74,Joel Miller,4,2014-07-09,"This is a very good public library with excellent policies designed to seriously involve the public. It is easy to navigate and there are many comfortable spaces work spaces. It is as good as most medium sized university libraries but falls short in some ways, particularly as much of its scope doesn't reach beyond Quebec. I can forgive them for the major holes in U.S. Canadian historic documents and in English literature to some extent but unfortunately the ethnocentric ethos extends to the sciences as I was doing research on North American geology and found very little south of the border that was useful and not much material for the rest of Canada.",None

76,Discovering Destinations,5,2017-07-08,"Where: BAnQ Grande Bibliothèque - Montreal, Quebec
What: A huge central library
How was it:  We are lucky because this place is very close to home.  It's so close that we'll go for long periods at a time without going or even forgetting it's there.
One of the perks of living on the island - you don't need to pay for the membership.  They have lots that you can check out online, even reading material, renew your almost due books with a simple click or even rent music or movies.  It's huge, well decorated and clean.  We'll even come to study here sometimes.

77,L B,4,2016-07-08,"Aside from the few rude security guards and few aggressive people, it THE library for everyone to go and have a good time reading, listening to music and watching movies. I've been a member since 2012 and I only go there now for my book borrowing. At first I wasn't sure if it was expensive to join or if I had to live downtown in order to join, once learning that they except anyone regardless of municipal heresay I was overjoyed and surprised. So many items and they keep improving and adding more features and services each and every year to make the members more happier. They sell items during the Summer outside til Fall and have the once-a-season merchandising sale. Its truly one of the best places ever built in this city and am very thankful and  happy it exist.",None

82,Sam “montrealsam” Totah,5,2020-07-07,Excellent!  Huge place. Friendly personnel! A great many subjects. You need several visits to get to know. Some sectors full of students. Public stay on the ground floor. Children section is paradise. Music and video section for the connaisseur. The only missing point there is no personnel to help you if your computer fails. You are on your own. Limited print section. Besides books there are activities such as lectures. First come or reservation. Strongly suggest you visit to feel at home! February 2020 still 1 of the best spots in Montreal! Visit & re-visit at your leisure!,None

Keep up the good work.",None

Warning: It is best not to visit the bathrooms ( especially those outside the ground floor 'sensor' area) as the guards will follow patrons ( men OR women)  inside, and wait directly outside the stall while the patron performs their 'business'....this is 'normal' guard behavior, according to a library receptionist.

You can borrow books, dvds, audio cds, games and use their wi-fi if you have a BAnQ borrower's card which you can easily get if you have a driver's license or other proof of residency documents.

They have desks, comfortable seating places and even space for watching movies in the 4th floor. Located in the downtown area there are plenty of cafes and restaurants around.

The bad: Their costumer service is very unprofessional and easy to snap at you with rude remarks. I was inquiring for printing and photocopies and the clerk laughed at me saying they were not a printing house. I didnt understand why they were charging a few fees for late return and upon asking I met with staff that gave me attitude. I paid the fees since I did bring the material late yet dealing woth their costumer service was not a pleasure. Lastly on this note they really dont have a lot of english material, they have more french which is okay for me.

The security guard approached me and insisted that I have to leave without giving any reason and forced me to stand in the cold for 10 minutes.","Hi! Thank you for sharing this with us.

Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ) makes sure the audiovisual collection is regularly and properly maintained. We repair faulty discs by polishing the reading surface. This type of damage can occur occasionally because of the high circulation that this collection is subjected to and the difference in the reading quality of home devices. If you encounter a problem with one of our CD or DVD, you can alert us by inserting a little note about the problem in the case or the flap when you return the item. You can also bring the item to one of our staff member at the service counter on the main floor of the Grande Bibliothèque. We will then determine if a cleaning or polishing is required. If the disc is too badly damaged, we will try to replace it."

ATTENTION: if you put $3, it will only give you time for $2 and the machine will eat your extra $1 without any chance to get it back.  So if you put $3 you will get time for $2.

Plusieurs endroits pour s'installer : tables de travail et chaises, malheureusement les fauteuils confortables ont été jeté par prévention contre les punaises.

J'apprécie beaucoup le fait qu'on y trouve 2 cafés : le Parva dont l'un est situé au rez de chaussée qui comprend l'espace actualités fermant tard, un vrai plus !

J'AI PAS COMPRIS...(et je ne ronflais pas lol). Même maintenant le souvenir me blesse un peu (surtout qu'être réveillée en plein sommeil, ça met pas de bonne humeur et qu'après je dois me forcer à rester éveillée).

I have rarely been late in returning a book or cd and the fines are super small, there is no problem with that, the staff is very willing to help you in everything, if you want to study or concentrate there is plenty of space for that!

Nous regrettons que votre récente visite à la Grande Bibliothèque n’ait pas été agréable. La présence d’un très grand nombre de personnes dans l’édifice de la Grande Bibliothèque contribue à hausser le niveau sonore.

Certains endroits de la bibliothèque sont plus silencieux, entre autres les terrasses de lecture du niveau 2 et 3. Ces étages sont ouverts les mardis, mercredis, jeudis et vendredis soirs, mais pas les samedis et dimanches soirs.

Soyez assuré que cette problématique nous préoccupe et que nous cherchons à l’améliorer.

Nous invitons les visiteurs à respecter le Code de conduite des usagers, dans lequel nous leur demandons de maintenir une ambiance calme et agréable. C’est pourquoi nous sensibilisons régulièrement les usagers et les membres du personnel de Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec à la question du bruit. Chaque usager est tenu de respecter le code. Si vous constatez certains comportements inappropriés de la part d’usagers, nous vous invitons à signaler aux employés du comptoir de services ou du Service de sécurité toute situation qui, selon vous, requiert une intervention. Nous rappellerons au personnel et aux agents de sécurité l’importance d’intervenir lorsque de telles situations sont portées à leur attention. Pour lire le Code : https://www.banq.qc.ca/a_propos_banq/mission_lois_reglements/lois_reglements_politiques/autres_documents/code_responsabilite_usagers/index.html?language_id=3
