1,Mo French,5,2023-05-05,Beautiful place to go walk or fishing,None
2,Glen Mac,4,2021-07-04,Been going here since my teens and it’s always been a great spot.  You have to pay to get in now if you’re not a resident but it’s not expensive.   They’ve also gated off the damn so you can’t Jump but I wouldn’t recommend doing that anyway.   Check it out if you’re in the area.  Hidden gem in the West Island!,None
3,Peijie Li (P.J.),1,2022-07-04,There’s a 15 dollar entry fee and 30 dollar if you have a trailer. Way too expensive for a small park that doesn’t have much. Would not recommend.,None
4,Jason Pluta,4,2021-07-04,Very nice park. Been going there for over a decade. Thank you for repairing the roads inside the park. Hopefully they will be able to do more repairs on standing structures and maybe revive the main area.,None
5,Marine Vitt,5,2021-07-04,Beautiful place for the bike ride,None
6,Mega Bear,2,2021-07-04,"Don't expect anything spectacular, but you can get close to waterfront and sit, fish. But it is not welcoming. A bit of a hangout. Not for younger kids. There's better to be had elsewhere ☺️.",None
7,rodrigo linck,4,2021-07-04,"Beautiful place to fish, for a nice bike ride or just go for a walk. Not much infrastructure but a great opportunity to be in contact with nature.",None
8,Bob Cartwright,1,2022-07-04,$15 bucks to park is a disgrace. Got a $79 dollar parking ticket. There is a parking for cars but its signs are off the main road and not that obvious.,None
9,Jill S,3,2021-07-04,It's a beautiful area. $10 per car for non-residents. The trails are not well indicated and there is garbage everywhere.,None
10,Hamid Rad,5,2022-07-04,"Very Old port , Relaxing Place where you find yourself so attached to the nature",None
