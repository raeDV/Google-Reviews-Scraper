2,Stef,2,2023-06-29,"I feel really bad leaving a negative review but I hated my experience. I wanted a refill and design, to start, I guess I had a new employee drilling literally down my nail. My refill felt like she was gonna take my whole nail off. I felt my actual nails burning. After that when she started filling… the acrylic was so poorly done I had to make her stop. Another lady came and helped, who knew what she was doing but she didn’t care about listening to me. Anyway.. after all that I thought ok whatever I’ll get the design I want and leave. Mind.. people are waiting… so my design didnt look right. I made comments about it but I guess all they care is.. suivant-next and getting paid. I know they are famous for their insta which is beautiful but I would definitely NOT be returning here. Plus the price was way too high for the service I got.","Hi Rebecca!
I’m so sorry for your first time experience at Holly. I’m Thanh the one did the design on your nails. I do care about you and willing to change your design or return your payment if you are not happy with the results and I would always tell you the price of the design before doing them.

In our place, we have all appointments clients, the clients was waiting because they came early….
Anyway I’m sorry for the uncomfortable feeling that you had and I wish you that I can do something to make you feel better ❤️
Call us again next week Rebecca!
With love💕 
Thanh."
