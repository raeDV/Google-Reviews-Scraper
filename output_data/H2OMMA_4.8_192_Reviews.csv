4,Deborah Mete,5,2022-08-10,"H2O is an amazing gym. Staff and clients are all friendly and welcoming.
I have to say, that it‚Äôs been only a month and a bit since I‚Äôve joined the women's kickboxing boot camp class. Not only is the class a great workout, it‚Äôs motivating and fun and always makes you want to come back for more. Richard and his trainers are all wonderful and determined to make us pull a sweat. They take their time to explain the routine and make sure to stand close by should you need any guidance. I have gained more strength and continue to see a difference in my body.
I have lost 15 pounds in little over a month ,and will continue to to be determined and motivated thanks to Richard and his team.
Thanks again üòä",None
5,Monyka R.,5,2022-08-10,"H20 MMA is a good stop for all levels. Richard easily integrates newbies, motivates intermediates, and pushes advanced learners. He‚Äôs passionate about the sport, his business, and is attentive towards his students. The gym culture is also positive. His staff is knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. I‚Äôve always felt comfortable asking a question. It‚Äôs all about having fun, getting a good sweat, and learning. See you there!",None

7,Gabriela Correa Mart√≠nez,4,2022-07-06,"I went to their women's kickboxing classes for almost four months and I have to say they're great!.
Super nice staff, easy to pay and really nice and open spaces to practice.
The only thing that I was missing is the feedback from the teacher, so is kinda difficult to know your mistakes, specially being a beginner.
But overall, recommended!",None

12,D. P.,5,2022-09-09,"Haven't trained here for years due to not living in Montreal anymore but I felt a need to shout out this gym.

H20 is probably the most accessible MMA gym in Montreal. Tristar is the most well known and famous but it can be a bit intimidating for newer people. A lot of other ""MMA"" gyms often are really good at one aspect of MMA and are lacking in others areas. Richard is a black belt in BJJ and a well accomplished  striking coach so he's built a pretty good all around gym. I'm mostly just a grappler so I can only comment on the BJJ here and it's great with a lot of variety and skill levels. The facility being as large as it is makes for a great training space as well.

Richard is also legitimately one of the nicest gym owners in the city. Not a mean bone in his body.",None
13,Sofia Fabritchny,5,2022-07-06,"Been training at this gym since April and I love it! Very professional environment, great instructors and teachers. Learned a lot of things and was able to progress in martial arts. I would recommend to anyone, you will not regret it!",None

Richard the head coach gives attention to all his students regardless of their experience or goals in the sport. The guys there are very humble too especially the pros they never hesitate to help out.,None
15,Martin Spasov,5,2022-07-06,Amazing gym and coaches. I felt welcome from the day i walked in and have been going almost daily since. Usually this caliber of mma gyms are not that beginner friendly since they focus on their professionals but Coach Ho takes the time to be there with every single student regardless of experience. I am happy to say that H2O is like my second home right now and would recommend it to anyone!,None
16,Alex Guindon,5,2022-07-06,"Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a pro, H2O MMA is by far the best martial arts gym in Montreal. Everyone is so knowledgeable, professional and welcoming. I‚Äôve been going there for a couple of months and I absolutely love it. Highly recommend!",None
17,Vijay Valentino,5,2022-07-06,"For years I tried to find the right training facility for my son & daughter to train at. A place that has a professional and safe environment to teach mix martial art. I personally myself did 7 years of personal 1 on 1 training in ninjutsu/jujitsu with my Sensei who has several dan black belts in different styles of martial arts and who also happened to also lived in Japan.
I wanted my kids to get the same level of technical experience, and Richard & his team from H20MMA bring exactly just that. Hand down H20MMA is a much more modern & up to date MMA facility that guarantees to create confident individuals. It‚Äôs also an added plus to see real professional MMA fighters daily at this facility with really professional fighting records. Just as a parent, You can visually learn and understand the work ethic these pro fighters have to be at their personal best, so imagine what you will learn by getting into the octagon.
Hands down this is best MMA facility in all of Montreal for all ages.
Most importantly, the place is well equipped, modern, clean, A+ hygiene.
Btw thanks Martin for being an excellent coach, my main manüëäüèΩ.",None
18,Anja Moritz,5,2021-07-06,"Amazing kickboxing classes! Richard (the owner) always mixes up things so you get a great workout and leave feeling happy, relaxed, exhausted and already looking forward to the next class.

20,Cliff Meister (Ronin Marketing),5,2022-07-06,"Before signing up, I did jiu-jitsu for 5-6 years. But I felt I had a gap in striking and wrestling.

There aren't many martial arts schools that offer multiple disciplines.

I decided to register at H2OMMA with Richard as a coach because he is an excellent coach and he adapts his lessons well to the students.

I love training at this gym because not only are the classes great, but we also have the flexibility to train as we want according to our goals.

Also the gym is always clean, which is an important factor for me.",None
21,Samuell S. G. Beaudoin,5,2022-07-06,"I've been to many different MMA gyms and H20 is definitively my favorite.

Definitely the best gym I‚Äôve ever been to!",None
25,Lyn W,5,2020-07-06,"I had a great time here! I was interested in kickboxing, and their intro women's only class was the absolute best. Everyone is super friendly, and you get to learn a really wide variety of basic punches and kicks, along with general training exercises. It's an excellent stress reliever, and I was always wiped after each class. Great workout! There's also a more advanced MMA class once you get more experienced, along with one-on-one training for serious folks. Highly recommend!",None

30,Milka lins,5,2020-07-06,"Hello everyone!
What an amazing experience I had at H2O, the woman kickboxing classes are just fantastic!
Initially, I was a bit worried as I have never done any kind of art martial classes before, but the atmosphere is super friendly, our coach Mr. Richard Ho is also accommodating, that makes the difference! he is always ready to help (even for the clumsy ones! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

32,Simon Massaglia,5,2022-07-06,"Best MMA / boxing / Muay Thai  / BJJ gym in the country. Coach Kevin Lan is the best boxing coach you can ask for. He‚Äôs the most dedicated caring and passionate coach you will ever meet. I‚Äôve taken many private‚Äôs with him and attended his boxing classes in the past and I see amazing results every time. Make sure to ask about him when you get a chance to stop by and train. The knowledge of boxing this guy has is down to a surgical precision, he‚Äôll take the tome to correct every detail and make you think not a better fighter or simply get into the best shape of your life.

H2O MMA has an amazing facility, clean and very well taken care of.

I will say one thing, Richard is by far one of the nicest guys I've ever met in my life, so soft spoken, and yet a true warrior. I was dealing with a sciatic nerve injury way back and I even called the gym and asked his advice about it, he legit took a good 20 minutes on the phone with me giving me great advice about it.

51,Cassandra E,5,2020-07-06,"I attended the free self-defense class taught by Ariane and Richard and it was a wonderful experience. I really appreciated the fact that at the beginning they talked about how the event came about and that it was by and for women. The fact that they gave us a lot of time to practice each move and came by everyone to give a little advice reinforced why they did this event and made me feel at ease!
I didn't feel rushed and felt like it resonates with what I needed!

I found it at H2OMMA.  The training staff in knowledgeable.  Techniques are often shown in a way that can be adapted for grappling as well as MMA and even self-defense.  There is a  great pool of people to spar with from beginners to very experienced.  That is extremely important as you need to be able to test your skills against stronger opponents in order to improve.  On top of that people are friendly and no egos on the mat! The facilities also offer the option to work on your cardio and weight lifting.  The schedule gives you many options to train either Muay Thai or grappling or MMA.  I can recommend this gym to either someone visiting from out of town who wants to keep up their training schedule, someone with a goal of getting in shape or wants to get into martial arts/MMA.",None
63,Jennifer Johnson,5,2015-07-08,"One of the first things that struck me about H2O was the technical level of many of the students that had been there a while. Not only were they friendly and welcoming, but many of them were also incredibly impressive fighters and more than happy to pass on their knowledge and support in class. I was introduced to and formed a new respect for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, traditional Muay Thai and MMA as it is today. Good students are a reflection of great teachers, and this is definitely the case with Richard Ho and the whole H2O team.",None

70,Dee Dee,5,2020-07-06,"I have been going there for some time. I have to say that their approach is pretty organized. By the end of the week, you feel a lot more confident in what you are doing. The next week, we learn new things but always stringing along what we have previously seen. It is very efficient. I have only been there for a couple of months and I see results. I recommend this to people of all levels.

For those who might feel intimidated at first, it is really worth the shot. Granted you will have to work hard to apply what you will see, that's ok. It's part of the process. Plus, this aspect is pretty much the same anywhere else.

Honestly, feel free to ask the teachers anything. They will be eager to help. And if you feel like you're harassing them, dont. They wont feel that way. They will be more than happy to help. This is coming from someone who had poor hand-eye coordination and two left feet. I couldnt even hold the pads until a month later. And through asking questions and taking time to observe the class, I was able to make good progress.

It's really worth a shot. You get to try each class for free so you can judge for yourself. You've got nothing to lose so, why not? üòéüëç",None

We give kickboxing and brazilian jiu-jitsu classes to people, we do not fix machines or offer any services of that kind.  You must be mistaking for someone else's business.
