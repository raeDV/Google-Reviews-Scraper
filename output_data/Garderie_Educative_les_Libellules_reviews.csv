1,Ngayan Kwok,5,2022-09-01,"My daughter has been studying here for over a year, she is very happy every day and she learns a lot.  Even parents can feel that the whole environment is full of love, the teachers' attentive care, the sincerity of all the school staff and the principal to the children, and even feel that they are like our family.  I still remember my daughter coming to Day Care on the first day, the teacher took the initiative to carry her into the classroom, and then dragged her little hand out after class. After a while, my daughter also asked me not to pick her up too early every day.  I am so grateful for everything at Libellules. I’m pretty sure I made a right choice for my daughter.",
2,Nazanin Amirifard,5,2022-09-01,This is an excellent and educational daycare . The manager is very good and the educators are professional and kind. I would like to say a big thank you to Madam Leila. We had to leave Montreal and hope we can find a good daycare like here for our son.,
3,María Gabriela Zurbarán Duque,5,2022-06-28,My daughter has been attending this daycare since she was 8 months. It’s been almost four years and she loves going there and I feel she extremely happy sharing with friends and teachers. She learns a lot everyday. Even she is already fluent in English and French. I highly recommend this daycare!,
4,Nawaf Duoara,5,2022-06-28,"We really loved this place. My daughter was always happy there. She loved the food, the acitivities, the educators, everything! It’s a family business and my daughter felt exactly like that, in family!! The owners are so nice and always finding ways to improve and offer the best possible service. We had to leave this daycare because we moved out of Lasalle, but we miss it so much 😢. We’re really grateful for all the amazing care my daughter received here. I strongly recommend it 100%. Your children will always be in good hands.",

6,Frankie Luzi,5,2021-06-28,"Our son absolutely loves it here. Started daycare in August of 2020, during a pandemic, and the staff has been exceptional. Such an incredible group of individuals here. Lovely little spot for our son. We enjoy the art work that is always sent home and the photos from the daily activities. Thank you for the hard work and dedication!",
7,Frankie Lin,5,2022-06-28,"Excellent Garderie, my daughter has been in this kindergarten for nearly 3 years, and the staffs has always taken care of her carefully and kindly. She absolutely love here and can't wait to go back every day. It provides bilingual education, and fun indoor or outdoor activities are arranged every week.",
8,Li Li,5,2022-06-28,"My son went to the daycare for 2 years, now he's is now in elementary school. He was well prepared, their program is outstanding from other's daycare (he perfectly know how to write the alphabet at age of 5). Daycare super clean, the educator are qualified and director very flexible to answer any questions.  Thank you for all the good work Les Libellules",
9,Jj Fan,5,2022-08-02,"If I want to name one thing that is good during COVID, that would absolutely be my daughter got to stay in this daycare center, because it was really difficult to get a spot in here pre-COVID. We got a spot because many people stopped sending their children to daycare centers in 2020. I digressed, about this daycare center which I really like, co-owners and educators are treating children with all heart, there are various activities in diversity. Even a top rank of 5-star is not enough to justify my satisfaction level. I already recommended this daycare center to my new neighbor and they are sending their child.",

**************
Friday November 5 I dropped off my daughter. She  was not sick, she wasn’t coughing, no fever, nothing.

My mom went to pick her up that afternoon and
Mind you Nova ALWAYS run out when we go pock her up.

This time they carried her to my mom and the second my mom saw she called and told me Nova was not breathing properly.  You could CLEARLY see her throat and stomach forcing for air.

We took her to the ER and saturation level was at 84-86%!!!  We spent 3 days in the hospital and she still has breathing issues.  The daycare neglected to call me or 911 while my daughter was gasping for air!  Lord knows how long she went struggling for air.

When I went to talk to them yesterday, the director told me and I quote
« oxygen is inside the body we can’t see what’s inside the body »
« We’re not health specialist »
« having inhalers isn’t a big deal people live with it fine »

The was no sence of urgency on their part, they did not look to have an investigation nor to try to see what happen to prevent it from happening…no excuses were made for what happened, they just told me I was looking for trouble.  They just didn’t care and seemed to just want to wash their hands from it.

They also told to got talk to the ladies, but weirdly enough none of them came in this morning","We are extremely saddened to receive this review from someone who not only does not use our services, but is also based on false and incomplete information.

11,EVA K.,5,2021-06-28,"Beautiful daycare, very clean, the staff is super gentle and professional and their educative program is outstanding (they do outdoors activities / Writing  / Science experiments / Cooking class / Yoga / Once a week english class). Well Happy Kids, happy parents. Highly recommended !",
12,U T,5,2022-06-28,"I am extremely saddened to see all the false information that have been posted in other reviews. People should do their own research and hear the two sides of a story before deciding to ""cancel"" a local daycare. I do not stand for hate speech. I saw that one person posted negative reviews at least 5 times under different accounts. Future parents should know that this daycare will do the absolute best to take care of their children.",

Friday November 5 I dropped Nova at her daycare (garderie éducative les libellules - Lasalle on 7964 Allard street).  Nova was not sick, she wasn’t coughing, no fever, nothing.

14,D,5,2022-06-28,"I saw many copy and paste reviews which is unfair for such a nice daycare center. I have child staying here, what I saw is a really wonderful place for toddlers, owners and educators care so much of the children.",
15,Moralo Media,1,2022-06-28,They neglected a baby with respiratory difficulties.  They didn’t call the mother nor the paramedics.

18,Belt of Truth,5,2021-06-28,They take care of the kids well. The kids enjoy it.  They are fed well and they learn a lot.,
19,Jean-François Gélinas,5,2022-06-28,"Nos enfants ont passé 4 ans à cette garderie et ce fut une merveilleuse expérience. Les locaux sont grands, éclairés et bien garnis en jouets
L'équipe de direction est compétente et choisi les éducatrices avec soin. Le programme éducatif est exceptionnel. Les repas sentent délicieux le matin, ça nous donne envie de rester pour l'heure du lunch. Les enfants de bébé à pré-scolaire reviennent heureux à la maison et on hâte d'y entrer le matin. À la fin de leur parcours, ils partent bien formés pour l'école et parfaitement bilingues.",
20,Massil,5,2021-06-28,"Ce que j’ai aimé par dessus tout dans cette garderie sont les diverses activités qui sont offertes aux enfants, incluant le yoga et les cours de cuisine. Le fait que la garderie soit bilingue permet d’aider nos enfants à développer une seconde langue très tôt. De plus, leur parc privé permet aux enfants de s’épanouir en plein air à tous les jours en toute sécurité. Les éducatrices sont très gentilles et professionnelles. Je recommande fortement cette garderie.",
21,safae yassine,5,2022-06-28,"Mon fils a passé plus de 2 ans dans cette garderie. C'était un endroit d'épanouissement et d'apprentissage.
Il n'a que 4 ans et il parle couramment en Anglais, uniquement grâce à la garderie.
À la direction, il y a des gens compréhensifs et de confiance qui donne toujours plus de leur temps et leur attention.
Merci à vous et à toutes les éducatices vous allez nous manquer!",
