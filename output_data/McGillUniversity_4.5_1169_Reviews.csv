1,Terry Chu,5,2023-03-08,"One of the top universities in the world. Located by the hills of Mount Royal, the landmark of Montreal, McGill enjoys the advantages of mountain views as well as the convenience of downtown life. It’s located in the financial district. It’s amazing to see how many buildings are there in the campus. Students here are really smart and creative. It’s pleasant to be a student studying in this vibrant campus. Across from the campus main entrance, there is a wonderful church People’s church for students and faculties to enjoy Christian life and fellowship.",None
2,Ryder B.,4,2023-06-06,"Gorgeous campus. Each building has its own unique character to it. I did my undergrad here and had an amazing experience. I met many great people from different walks of life. It is definitely a rigorous academic environment but I was pleased to see that professors were always available and willing to help (at least in my Faculty). Some of the classrooms are a bit small for the number of students in them and getting around the campus in the first year was tough, but you get used to it. The worst part is the climb up the Education hill. Unfortunately, the pathways on the campus are not salted properly during the winter months which can pose a challenge as you navigate between buildings. Most of McGill’s facilities are modern and welcoming and never had problems with administration. Excellent location too as it is downtown and many stores and restaurants nearby.",None
3,Naomi Braude,5,2023-06-06,"Great university! So proud to have received my degree from such a prestigious university, in the most beautiful city in North America.

5,Jessica Sun,5,2022-07-06,"The campus is so gorgeous, especially on a sunny day! We came on a Sunday so a lot of the buildings were closed, but we were still able to enjoy the architecture from the outside, as well as take a look in the Redpath Library.",None
6,Benyamin Feghhi,4,2023-06-06,"Been a student for a while and I can say they do accommodate for travel within campus even in winter when it’s the most slippery due to snow. However, there is no reason why any body would come here for a walk or cycling. It’s not really a park or a tourist attraction. If you want to walk( walk in saint Catherine). If you want to cycle( cycle in Maisoneuf). If you come because your asked to, It is a pleasant place and you wouldn’t be bother with being technically in an institution.",None

8,Luis Daniel,3,2022-09-09,Nice University but its way too cold in Montreal most of the year to enjoy yourself and have fun. As a result most kids end up staying indoors too much. There is something off with this university despite it being called the Harvard of Canada.,None
9,Vee Dinh,4,2021-07-06,"This school is huge and beautiful. It was so enjoyable walking around the campus. There was not a lot students when I visited but sometimes, there were still students running to class or biking around. So photogenic at the same time.",None

19,Andi,4,2022-11-08,I completed my bachelor's here around 2020. It is a great educational institution and I enjoyed my journey.

31,Vasily R,5,2022-07-06,"Great school where I got a degree that helped me work at top tech companies. Professors can be bad with a cushy tenure and teaching for them is just a nuisance, but they have a good network of volunteering tutors, mental help programs, scholarships, etc to help you get through college. Lots of events and parties to be found, both official ones and not. Depending on the faculty, people can get pretty competitive and not share notes etc so it’s very much a clique-based group study environment. Better become friends with the right people!

Student run societies can be disorganized and often things get pretty political, but the overall culture is that of excellence and this college really helped me “learn how to learn”.

Cafeterias are pretty overpriced but coffee shop in Adams is good. Hunt for those samosa sales. They’re addictive!

I gladly donate to my department almost every year, but their calls can start getting a bit annoying, especially when they call multiple times a year to ask for money.

With all that said, I would come back here and do it all over again if I had a Time Machine!",None

37,Oliver,2,2022-07-06,"The school likes to pretend it‘s the Yale or Harvard of Canada but it’s nowhere close, has far too much prestige and deserves none of it. Classes with shallow material. No student support (if there is any, it’s very, very unaccessible - good luck being able to make any appointment ever). Disinterested and tired professors with a lack of energy. You can get more value for the tuition paid here through YouTube videos, masterclasses, almost any other form of learning that actually tries to grab the viewer’s attention and teach something meaningfully. Here, the professors do not seem to feel like they even need to try. Very poor on-campus atmosphere as students are miserable and confused due to the lack of support during difficult times. It was a big mistake to come here rather than go to the US; the only good decision was leaving before it was too late.",None
38,Etienne Champanhet,1,2022-07-06,"Canada. Oh Canada. One of the most heavily marketed countries in the world. When you research Canada you are marketed one of the most “beautiful” and “welcoming” countries in the world. It couldn’t be further from the truth. When my wife and I graduated high school we decided to move to Canada to start our lives and we couldn’t think of a better place to call home. We imagined our lives were going to finally be established - after uni, we would find jobs there, buy a home and start a family.
How wrong we were.
Canada is a complete farce. For international residents, it’s almost impossible to integrate - socially, culturally and practically. Despite being extremely financially well off and stable(over a million in investments), we were unable to even get a mortgage when attempting to purchase property because of our ‘international’ status. Attempting to get a permanent residence cost money, time, stress and would’ve required us to move away from the semi-home we established. With our international status, we were forced to pay ridiculously high amounts of tuition - which then couldn’t be put to good use afterwards, since it was difficult to find decent jobs that didn’t prioritize local residents. Furthermore, as good tax paying residents - we got terrible service. Poor health care, and absolutely ZERO infrastructure. The infrastructure is an absolute joke. It’s none existent. Travel is an absolute no go in Canada because any domestic flight will cost you upwards of 400 per person. Which makes sense when you take into account how massive Canada is with a population smaller then Californias. But since then my wife and I have relocated to The Netherlands and we couldn’t be happier. We got approved for a mortgage within 4 months of living here, and everything just makes sense here. The government really do care about there citizens and your tax money actually brings you somewhere. Be cautions of all the great reviews you read about living in Canada online, because most of them are most probably fake. Canada NEEDS immigrants and those universities are a money making business that will go to any length to get you to pay them money. Even if it means paying people in less wealthy countries to flood the internet with positive reviews about Canada.",None

45,79 EDM,3,2022-07-06,"The Univeersity of McGill looks and feels like a beautiful university.

The Univetsity does have a lot of Green Space and trees and they should continue to plant more trees and have parks and Green spaces for the city. It feels nice to visit especially since it located right into the heart of the city and you feel and see students from all over the world.

What I heard from former and current students is that it is a difficult university to get into.  Of course the Marks are stricter and levels are above average and you need to meet their expectations. So for sure is is like the Oxford University of the country.

They also have good and great vocational and certificate programs if they interest you as well.

The library there is nice as well. A little bit rundowned and old. When I Visited.  They need to renovate as well. As soon as they get the chance.

Of course Concordia is easier to get into if the programs you are applying for is similar but there are programs that are not avaible at McGill and Vice Versa. It is a prestigious university so that is why it is ranked in the Top 50.

Hope this University becomes an Environmentally sustainable university. Zero Waste, Carbon Zero, Zero Greenhouse emissions and Reduce their pollution or emit less. Also all their buildings should be leed Platium or Gold so that it is adaptable to climate change.

In my books it is a nice university and all alumni and former students  who studied there should have the privilege to be apart of the Univeristy.

At the end of the day it does not matter. All students and staff need to respect themselves and vice versa so that we can make a change for the better of the human kind with the education and services you receive from McGill University.",None

Was needing help with my mental health after being mugged near my res but was pushed around the system for a while before finally being able to see a psychiatrist. Who never even looked at me directly while we had our sessions and merely sent me off with a prescription for anti-depressant.

65,Ralph W,4,2017-07-07,"McGill is a great university, I was student there for 3 years. The campus is really nice, but walking uphill in the winter can be somewhat tricky and dangerous. The distance between buildings makes getting to class on time a real challenge.

The historical buildings are very nice from the outside, but could use some serious renovations on the inside. The campus has been transformed into a big construction site in the last two years, making tuition there less enjoyable. The librairies get very crowded and hot during exam season and renders study rooms unavailable.

The quality of education is excellent and increases as the classes shrink in size because the learning experience is enhanced.

On as an ""R1"" (i.e. research-focused) school, it is clear that research is the emphasis at McGill, often to the exclusion of teaching.  In my experiences as a student representative on governance committees, and more recently as an employee, it is easy to see how reduced funding and cuts have diminished the quality of student services across many of the departments at McGill.  In addition to greater funding focused on student experience, and teaching quality, I would like to see the culture at McGill shift towards a more student-friendly and student-focused model.",None

Some faculties and departments have very racist, demoralized, and petty professors who are far from reaching the world class status. As I studied here as an international student, I experienced a lot of racism and prejudice displayed by McGill profs. Students, especially Canadian resident students are quite vulgar as compared to students in Ivy League University. After all, it is very corrupt place but keeps calling their alumni asking for donations. I have come across with many international students who complained about the same issues, such as racism, faculty demorality, opportunistic professors who want to embellish their profiles, etc. There are some strong faculties but there are also poor quality petty trade faculties. After all, it is not a good school at all. Avoid at all costs.",None

The truth is that racist exists everywhere across the world but generally speaking, McGill is a very international and open university and would not judge you by your race. Yes, McGill has its problems. But it is still a very prestigious university and we as McGill students are proud of our university (There's a few complaints in McGill. But few complaints are very common in every university). And the academic atmosphere here is excellent, people are very kind, city is also awesome, and etc... but the weather sucks.

However, for some reason, the ""Rutherford Physics Building"" has not yet been renamed to ""The Rutherfordtress"". The latter seems a more apt title given the building's minimalist aesthetic qualities (only rivaled by the Leacock building) and sturdy bones. This would also properly communicate to the public our attempts to keep the physicists and their indeterministic science away from the rest of us, given that they are a threat to our precious causality.",None
