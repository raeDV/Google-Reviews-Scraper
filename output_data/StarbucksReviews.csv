1,5,After a tiring day walking around the city, we went for a cup of coffee. I find it interesting that people here speak french but some can answer you in fluent english. And they are very friendly too even if you are a complete stranger to them.,Adrielle Marl,2023-05-17
2,3,I don't know lol the service is great and very friendly but they add on a tip for themselves which is, well wrong, and they don't even give points for spending so much and being loyal so I am finding it hard to want to come back but yet the coffee is so delicious ðŸ˜‹,Ninja D,2023-06-02
