Thank you for your kind words about the Basilica's beauty. Indeed, you have guessed it - the maintenance of the church does require extra care, seeing as it is a masterpiece of gothic revival architecture that has endured almost 200 years of wear and tear. As you can imagine, this does not come cheap on a heritage building, so we are very grateful for every visitor's contribution towards maintaining the inside and outside of the Basilica so that future generations can enjoy its beauty as well! We are glad you enjoyed AURA , but might we add - taking pictures is forbidden during the experience. :-)
Have a good day!"
