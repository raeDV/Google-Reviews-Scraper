1,1,Be careful. Pay very close attention to prices at the checkout. Many items in this store have the wrong price. The funny thing is, when you tell them they say "I know" but won't change it. Staff is rude and will grab stuff out your cart just because. They need to keep their hands out of people's personal space. You don't need a job to know that. It's basic decency.,Amanda Hemmings,2023-04-06
2,5,Was there to purchase a leg of lamb. Also to purchase pork ribs. Both were very fresh and the store is clean and the service was friendly. For sure I will go back !,Suzanne Swain,2023-04-25
3,5,A big Provigo store. Provigo keeps it tight in maintaining its image. Overall a nice store. ➕ Big Store, Large Number Of Items, Clean, Self Checkout available, Friendly Staff, Ample Parking, Live soup and breakfast corner and tables to sit on mezzanine level. ➖ None.,Nilay Gabani,2019-04-30
