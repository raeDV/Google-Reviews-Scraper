3,5,I was sorry to see the review below and their bad experience here. Everybody has off days and it's an exception, not the norm. I have eaten the steamed buns from here many times and not once have found any unwanted contents or felt ill. The couple who run this store are so nice and sweet, its been my go-to for a while for a variety of instant noodles, frozen dumplings and other Chinese & Pan-Asian specialties. It's a great store run by great people and the prices are very reasonable as well. They can even make you your own custom dumplings if you bring them the contents (or buy them at the store) which is just awesome!,Adam Solomon,2021-12-22
4,5,If you are going to stop into one of the smaller neighbourhood Chinese markets in this area, Bonjour Supermarché is my top suggestion. It’s clean, well-lit, and well-stocked. I’m not an expert on Chinese cooking, but they seem to prioritize ingredients over prepared products. So things like sauces, preserved vegetables, flours, rice, etc. are given a lot of shelf space vs. prepared food. This is not to say they don’t have these sorts of things (they have a good selection of those greasy spicy bean curd snacks), but the proportion of cookies, cakes, and snacks appears to be lower than other stores in the area, larger or smaller. My only regret is that I didn’t check the reviews, or I would have tried a bun :(,Conner Morgan,2022-02-14
5,5,Amazing selection and services, but don't deliver...,George Dittrich,2023-03-21
