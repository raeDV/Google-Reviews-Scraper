1,Megan Hoy,5,2023-06-29,"Must visit in Montreal, whether for a bagel sandwich or picking up bagels for the week.

We got the traditional (smoked salmon & cream cheese) and the smoked meat sandwiches on a sesame bagel. Both were delicious, but I prefered the traditional a bit more and would order that one again next time. Could tell the bagels were fresh as they were still warm and soft. I love the slight chewiness of the bagels - they were so good we got a half dozen for the week and returned the following week.

*Cash and Canadian Debit only.",None
2,Karunya Rao,5,2023-06-06,"Boy oh boy, this famous bagel joint did not disappoint. We ordered a wow sandwich and a sesame bagel with garlic and herb cream cheese. The winner was clearly the bagel with cream cheese, because you could actually taste the subtle seasoning of the bagel itself. We brought back six more bagels back to the US to enjoy for three more breakfasts (sliced them in half and put them in a freezer bag). Toasted/ heated for a few mins and it's good as new (almost)",None
3,Kat J,5,2023-06-15,"This bagel place lives up to its hype. It is about a 10 minute walk from the subway stop, but worth the walk.There was a bit of a line to get inside to order. There is a good selection of bagels with various toppings. The bagel itself was very high quality. The iced coffee is also a popular option and it was pretty good as well.",None
4,Toni Sterling,4,2023-06-29,"The bagels are delicious and homemade! I ordered bacon, egg, cheese & tomato on an all dressed (everything) bagel with a black iced coffee. The coffee was nice and strong in flavor! The only downfall is they do not accept credit card - cash or debit only. Luckily, my friend had cash and treated. Would recommend.",None
5,Lisa Rodrigues,5,2023-03-08,"Do not miss! Such a great place. The waiting is long, you can always expect 20 people ahead of you in the line - but it‚Äôs so worth it. The dine-in line moves a little slow because there is limited seating.
We waited 30 minutes & dined in, had a traditional smoked salmon sandwich and the smoked meat sandwich, with the sesame and rosemary/sea salt bagel. Both were fabulous. The smoked salmon sandwich had generous amounts of cream cheese and capers. Loved it. Will definitely visit again when we are in Montreal to try out other combinations.",None
6,Anna,4,2023-05-07,"great bagels! but i think i prefer eating them fresh and plain. i got the lox bagel and they go very heavy with the cream cheese, which i don‚Äôt really like. the bagels itself are great though.",None
7,Lana Duncan,5,2023-06-06,"Me and my friend got the bagel Matin with bacon, pesto on an all dressed bagel. It was fantastic. The bagel itself was delicious and well toasted, on the thinner side but with all the fillings it was the perfect size. Many poppy seeds flew around but it was worth it.",None
8,Judy Duong,5,2023-05-07,"There‚Äôs a reason why there‚Äôs always a lineup - the bagels here are incredible! They have a great menu selection and they also sell merch at the counter. I ordered ‚ÄúLe Plateau‚Äù on an all dressed bagel for takeout. I waited about 20 minutes as it was a busy Saturday lunch but the staff were very efficient with sending orders out. The bagel was absolutely delicious and had the perfect amount of crisp, and the ingredients tasted so fresh. This place is a must in Montreal!",None
9,Mo Aziz,5,2023-06-15,Worth the hype! Definitely the best bagels I‚Äôve ever had. We went there on a Saturday around 8:30am and there wasn‚Äôt a line. They only accept cash and Canadian debit cards.,None
10,Aman Singh,5,2023-04-07,"This location is a must.  Their bagels are awesome and you'll find them in all of their locations. However, if you want their epic bagel sandwiches, then you'll have to visit this location.  So good, so fresh!  Another must visit in Montreal. While their I would set the delivery time every morning on DoorDash and have them deliver me a Salmon with cream cheese bagel.  Oh man, I want to go back so bad.",None
11,Abdilfatah,5,2023-06-15,"Soft,light, sweet, and crispy bagel. Fresh ingredients. The staff are cool. Quick service even when the line is outside of the door. Vegan cream cheese available",None
12,Jasmine Wong,5,2023-04-07,"Amazing bagels that I drive over 5 hours for! Always fresh and the perfect combination of soft and doughy. Fast friendly service to get you in  and out with your delicious bagels. Also sell all the fixings including cream cheese, lox and ready made sandwiches.

Pro tip: I slice and freeze my bagels to bring back to Toronto with me; perfect for toasting",None
13,Emily Zhang,5,2023-02-06,"Always amazing. Lineups are worth it. PLEASE TRY THIS at least once in your life, it is my favourite thing to eat in Montreal. The dining tables are typically seats of 4, and it‚Äôs always busy. And there‚Äôs a reason for that. Bagels are fresh almond with the amazing cream cheese that‚Äôs made homemade and whipped I believe? Customer service is great and organized. The vanilla latte is super good here and they make freshly squeezed juices. Would Recommend the Lox bagel (salmon, cream cheese bagel). If you‚Äôve never had these bagels, you‚Äôre missing out. Bring your cousins, grandma, and siblings to try the best bagel of your life",None
14,Kamus On,5,2023-01-07,"I came in a group of six, and we were immediately welcomed with smiling faces. We each ordered different bagels with spreads or in a sandwich. I ordered a cinnamon and raisin bagel with garlic and herbs cream cheese spread. The bagel was toasted very nicely and was filled with cream cheese. I also ordered a small coffee and I added milk and sugar. It would be nice if they had cream available, but it still worked out, and the coffee tasted good. Overall, I had a great experience here and would love to come back and try more bagels.",None
15,Christian,5,2023-06-22,"The bagel was delicious. Got the traditional on Apple maple. Sweet and savory.

Definitely get some extra bagels to go.",None
16,Johana Celis,5,2023-05-07,I love this place!! Best bagels I've tried in Montr√©al ! Their coffee is great too! Friendly staff,None
17,Alexander C,5,2023-02-06,St. Viateurs is the oldest bagel places in Montreal and it has stood the test of time all because of the mouth-watering bagels they serve. I never knew basil pesto and mayo would go so well together with the sesame bagel. Also ordered a latte and a breakfast of champions which was an exorbitant amt of fruits combined. The staff were courteous and warm. You have to try this if you want a bagel that would haunt you forever. Period ü•Ø,None
18,Richard D,5,2023-03-08,"Great bagel spot which is a must visit. The traditional and club just hit the spot. Very tasty and filling. Service was also top notch, friendly and courteous!",None
19,Alysia Raby,2,2023-06-29,"How is this place so highly rated? I really hope we just came at a bad time but what a waste of time and money. Waited in line for 20 minutes and paid too much for some mediocre bagels. We got two of their most popular specials and a poppyseed bagel with cream cheese and nothing wowed us. The bagels were dense, dry and lacked salt/flavor. It‚Äôs our first bagel in the city so really hoping Montreal has better options! The people that work here are very nice though.",None
20,Murielle Lily Edwards,5,2023-02-06,Best bagels in Montreal hands down. The service for eating in isn‚Äôt always the best but the plates are abundant and the bagels never disappoint! The take out counter also available with various bagel options (only freshly baked of course). They do not accept credit cards - debit or cash only. Saint-Viateur is an institution of our city with wood oven freshly baked bagels in the spot- definitely recommend a hot bagel to go or sitting down for lunch.,None
21,Julia P,5,2023-02-06,"Absolutely incredible bagels! They are 100% worth the wait. The staff are friendly and make the process smooth and easy to understand. I tried the blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese - and wow! it was amazing! My friend had the blt sandwich, also incredible! MUST try!",None
22,Zoe Rivera,5,2023-01-07,"This was our first stop when we arrived in Montreal. The bagels are so fresh and delicious! My husband had the smoked meat on the rosemary & sea salt bagel and I had a BLT on the same bagel. We should‚Äôve gotten them on 2 different bagels and shared! Cappuccino and hot chocolate were also delicious!
The atmosphere is great - everyone chatting and enjoying themselves. Staff were lovely and attentive!",None
23,Varun Chandrasekar,4,2022-11-08,"Came here for a Montreal style bagel and the lineup outside the shop on a Sunday morning itself revealed how sought after this place is. After a 30 minute wait, finally got my bagel sandwich. The staff was friendly and helpful (especially since I don't speak French and the menu was in all French). The bagel is very meaty, the lettuce and tomatoes are juicy, and the slice of Swiss cheese was a nice and thick cut. The pesto sauce gives it a nice zingy flavor and the couple of fresh crispy melon slices they gave helped soothe the saltiness at the end of the meal.",None
24,mish,5,2023-03-08,Delicious Montreal style bagels. The service was great and they were very good at giving us updates on wait times. Highly recommend the smoked salmon traditional bagel. You can also do takeout (the line is much shorter).,None
25,Josh Baltazar,5,2022-11-08,"Then went to St Viateur & Cafe. Ordered a Sesame Bagel with plain cream cheese. This was my first Montreal Bagel and you can really taste the sweetness of the bagel. But the sesame gave it really good crunch. Overall an amazing bagel. I also got a Latte, good pairing with the bagel. Got one of the bagel seasonings to go and great first bagel in Montreal.",None
26,Rose Winter,5,2022-12-08,"Best bagels in Montr√©al! Family-friendly location with seating, restrooms downstairs, courteous staff, and most importantly, delicious bagels! My family‚Äôs faves were blueberry, raisin, rosemary, and of course sesame. Containers of Canadian and US cream cheese (including a vegan option) and drinks are available in the fridge or you can buy fancy bagel sandwiches. If you‚Äôre just getting bagels, go to the line on the right. Sandwiches are to the left. Canadian debit and cash only, travelers!!",None
27,John Bathrick,5,2023-06-29,Enjoyed watching them make the bagels while we ordered a few dozen to take back to the states after our weekend in Montreal.,None
28,Christine Chuang,5,2022-10-09,"As a tourist visiting Montreal‚Ä¶ Surprisingly there was no line on a Friday morning around 8:30am! The bagel smells incredible. I got a sesame lox bagel, and bought another dozen to bring back to NYC! I love how warm, soft and fluffy the bagel is, and that slight sweetness is just perfect. They offer English menu too. Cash or debit card only.",None
29,Robert Zheng,4,2022-07-06,"Worth trying.

Line moves at a steady pace, if it's out the door, likely 20-30min wait. Busy on the weekend, there is a bagel only line. They only have 2/3 food preps for the sandwiches.

Smoked salmon bagel was tasty and good portion of Salmon and cream cheese. You can tell them to change to a different flavour of cream cheese. The Bagel itself is really good, crisp, soft but good chew.

DEBIT ONLY.",None
30,isabela m,5,2022-09-09,"Fantastic bagels. I got the WOW and it was indeed a WOW experience!! Delicious, fresh ingredients. Staff are great and attentive. They also have some great souvenirs to sell. Good environment to eat in, but separate line for those who want to grab and go.",None
31,Debbie Lu,5,2023-03-08,This place makes such great Montreal bagels. The service was so incredible. We also bought extra ones to take home - you can freeze them and eat them throughout the week.,None
32,gammeelovemusic,5,2023-01-07,Love this dine in bagel sandwich place!! The tradition one is my favorite! And the bagel is truly amazing especially after being baked and had it warm!,None
33,Deon Lim,5,2022-09-09,"Probably the best bagels in Montreal. We had the traditional , all dressed bagel and breakfast sandwich with poppy seed. Personally I think the traditional one is the best. Lots of bagels to choose from but you wont go wrong with choice of ‚Äúall dressed‚Äù. Portions were generous, and it serves melon on the side. They serve coffee as well.",None
34,Ash Hopkins,5,2023-06-06,Such amazing bagels and great service. It was fun watching the bagels be made.,None
35,Rafaella Puccia,5,2023-02-06,"Definitely worth trying. I went to St. Viateur in a saturday afternoon in summer, so the house was full, but the service was quick and I didn't wait long for my bagel. I ordered one of the classic flavours, with smoked salmon and cream cheese. Fresh ingredients and very good taste. A Montr√©al classic!",None
36,Debalina Saha,5,2023-04-07,"I had wanted to try this for a while, had their classic smoked salmon bagel with rosemary and sea salt bagel . It was served with two slices of cantaloupe on side.Never had a more freshly made bagel before. I wish I could live in this cafe.",None
37,Sevan Khatchkzian,4,2023-06-06,Sesame bagel was delicious but I prefer to be on top a little bit crunchy...,None
38,Natalie Hu,3,2022-10-09,"Bagels themselves are great and fresh, but the sandwiches are okay. They don‚Äôt take credit cards. Best to pay in CAD cash.",None
39,Crystal Chiang,5,2023-04-07,Absolutely the best bagels ever. The lines move efficiently and the staff is extra friendly! We went twice in 24 hours. Blueberry bagel is a MUST!,None
40,Jon Yip Chuck,5,2022-07-06,"Mtl bagels are famous for a reason and St-Viateur shows exactly why!

Seemingly endless stream of fresh stone baked bagels. The dough is sweeter than the typical bagel and works well with the many flavors they offer.

As this is a Cafe location they have bagel sandwiches, coffee, and other eats. Possibly the best bagel sandwich I've ever had, can't beat a lox on freshly baked sesame bagel.

Be prepared for huge lines but it's definitely worth the wait.",None
41,Jasmine,5,2022-09-09,"Came all the way from Toronto and was NOT disappointed. Went in this morning and the line up was long as expected, the space is small and cramped up but definitely has that cute busy bakery feel. Staff was very nice to us, and we bought several bags to bring back home for souvenirs haha. Also couldn‚Äôt forget to get a fresh one for the road‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt wait to come back!",None
42,Prarthana Thakkar,5,2023-01-07,"This cozy cafe serves the famous Montreal bagels. A wide selection of sandwiches and cream cheese flavors! I ordered a club bagel sandwich with mayo and pesto sauce, blueberry bagel-cream cheese, and all dressed bagel-herb and garlic cream cheese. The bagels tasted delicious and not dry!",None
43,Tiana Cornelius,3,2022-07-06,"Service:
The staff was so kind, totally helpful and didn‚Äôt mind helping us with our questions.

Ambiance:
Sunny patio and fresh air seating area are welcoming but it is busy and a touch loud.

Food:
We tried 3 different bagel sandwiches - one was a lox classic, one smoked meat with mustard, one ricotta with fig and balsamic
We also tried a plain and a poppy bagel with plain cream cheese to really try out the flavor of the bagels themselves. Everything was fine, nothing to right home about, maybe just my personal preference coming out, I think I‚Äôm actually a New York style bagel person deep down.

Everything was affordable and they had a decent iced latte.",None

46,Courtney Menard,4,2023-03-08,Delicious bagels and sandwiches! But very busy... Be prepared to wait in line for a while if you go at a prime time.,None
47,Patrick D,4,2022-07-06,You can‚Äôt miss this place while visiting Montreal! We stopped at this location during our trip and it was awesome. I ended buying several of their bagels but I love the classic flavours and rosemary sea salt! The process of making the bagels is so fascinating to see. Service was great and the price was very reasonable!,None
48,Jaspreet Sangha,1,2023-01-07,"Bagels were cold and the lettuce in my BLT bagel was clearly rotten. It was folded inside my sandwich which seemed like an effort to hide the rotten section. Could have gotten sick had I not opened the bagel sandwich to check. When asked, the server was adamant that the bagels were toasted, even though they were clearly very cold and did not acknowledge the rotten lettuce. Horrible decline in service.",None
49,Vanneza Bobadilla,5,2023-02-06,Absolutely delicious!!! I‚Äôm from nyc and I have to say these bagels are so much better lol definitely worth it to come and try a Montreal bagel!,None
50,DJ,5,2019-07-07,"Been in this place twice and find that the service and food quality is consistently great. The waitress, Melissa is quite fun, attentive and interactive. She made sure that all customers are attended appropriately. The bagels here are great tasting, tried the salt and rosemary and sesame. Coffee, both flavored and regular are also fantastic. Price wise, it's average. I would definitely recommend that you try this out.",None
51,Rhian Gastineau,3,2023-06-06,"We felt we needed to visit and while it was good, the lines were long and the bagels were not what were expected.  They don‚Äôt accept credit cards which I understand but a bit inconvenient as if you get out of line to find a bank machine offs of coming back as slim.

The rosemary and sea salt bagel was good but still not a place I will necessarily make a detour to visit again.",None
52,Hansong Kim,5,2020-07-06,"Awesome bagel shop and cafe

We had brunch at here and very good! Traditional bagel set include smoked salmon. salmon was not too salty. It was very good matching with cream cheese.

Tuna bagel was also big enough. I asked cream cheese instead of plain cheese, and she gave me cream cheese on the side. Fully enough quantity and delicious.

Staff was kinds and atmosphere was great. Everybody can see how they can bake bagel directly.",None
53,Kristen M,4,2023-06-06,"It's pretty good. I don't love Montreal style bagels (they're so thin...) but I think if you do want to try one this is the place. There is always a line but it moves quickly. My biggest dislike is that the drinks are premade. I ordered an iced coffee and he just grabbed some plastic cup from the fridge where the coke and stuff is, dumped half out and then added ice and milk???",None
54,yan wong,4,2022-07-06,"If you want to sit down and have some coffee time, it is definitely not a choice for you. It has lots of great cafe nearby. But, for a surprisingly great bagel at a good location it is recommended for you. If you are obsessed with bagel but do not have time to try all famous shops, please go to fairmount instead.",None

58,Pani,5,2019-07-07,"I went to this coffee shop for the first time with my husband, and it was really magnificent. Bagel's taste was very good, and the taste of cream cheese was very different and delicious. Also, pesto was very good for my husband's sandwichüëå.
I suggest this coffee shop.",None
59,Justin Wohl,5,2023-06-22,"These are some of ""the"" bagels that foodie Americans tend to consider necessary to have, when in Montreal, for well earned reasons.

Friendly and competent staff regularly move crowds through this cafe space, where there is seating, take-out, and bagel-only lines. Canadian debit or cash necessary. USD was accepted at 0.80. No credit. Coffee available on the takeout line.

Feeding 4+ people on most of my visits, I found i preferred to go from the bagel-only line, where it's okay to order even one bagel per order, and to choose from the containers of toppings available in fridges along the wall.

They have single serving and group-sized containers of cream cheese, including tofutti, as well as salmon, onions, tomatoes, etc. You're set.",None
60,Anas El-Aneed,5,2023-06-15,Never disappointed and I ate there many times. It is highly recommended üëå ‚Ä¶,None
61,Varun Garg,4,2023-05-07,"Most definitely lives up to the hype! I've never had not only bagels that tasted so fresh and soft, but a bagel sandwich where every ingredient felt so fresh and packed with flavour! As a lacto-vegetarian, the only option I had was the ""WOW!"" sandwich and it did not disappoint.

There's two small things as to why I've taken off a star. The first being the spicy marinated eggplant in the sandwich was just a little too tangy and has a very strong taste, so you don't get to actually taste much of the goat cheese or sun-dried tomato when eating the bagel, maybe putting less eggplant will not only make it easier to take a bite, but will balance out the flavour a little. Also the caramel latte I got wasn't mixed properly and all the syrup was stuck at the bottom :(",None
62,Malika A,5,2022-07-06,"I have heard that bagels in Montreal are considered some of the best in the world, second only to New York. This restaurant serves as confirmation. Their bagels are divine. St-Viateur Bagels cooks their bagels in a large (wood-fired?) oven right in front of you, and they‚Äôre often served warm. They‚Äôre crusty and soft, and their numerous cream cheese flavours compliment them well. I loved my rosemary and sea salt bagel, and my friends walloped theirs up as well. Definitely stop by here, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it.",None
63,Hasti Dave,2,2022-11-08,"Not sure what the hype is all about.  We heard about it, we went, we tried.  The bagels were hard and chewy.  They were pricey too and the surprise was they didn't accept any credit cards! Cash or debit only!

I am glad we checked it off of the list, not sure if I would ever recommend this to anyone. If you want to try it, all on you!",None

66,Saeed Mohammadkhani,5,2020-07-06,This is one of my favourite coffee shops in Montreal. You will be surprised by their bagels. Bagels are always fresh and delicious. You could have a lot of choices of sandwiches and bagels. They just accept cash or Canadian debit which is the only negative point.,None
67,Justin Lam,5,2022-07-06,"Can‚Äôt go wrong with the traditional sandwich. The everything bagel is my personal favourite since the caramelized onions add that extra dimension of flavour.

The Liberte cream cheese they use is also nicer than the standard Philadelphia one, but they sell both (in addition to a vegan option) by the bagel checkout at the back.",None
68,Martyn Z,5,2023-05-07,"Loved the food, the cafe, the staff the ambience. Oh and good coffee.",None
69,Forest CPB,5,2021-07-06,"Yummy!

Friendly staff, quick service, deliciously fresh bagel.

Got the WOW! bagel (goat cheese, lettuce, pickled eggplant, sun dried tomatoes on everything bagel). Perfect amount of spice. Lots of flavour!

Brewed coffee was meh.

Highly recommend!",None
70,swetha medavarapu,5,2022-10-09,Bagels were really good. Loved the pesto sauce with the sandwich! We stood in the line for 40 mins but was worth it!,None
71,Ashley Perssico,5,2018-07-07,These bagels are incredible. They are hand rolled and so soft. I ordered the strawberry cream cheese and I have been dreaming of it every day since! The place itself is so cute and has an open kitchen where you can watch the chefs rolling and baking the bagels all morning. Service was great and the food came out quickly. I will definitely be returning!,None
72,James Hennig,5,2022-11-08,"Fantastic ‚Äútraditional‚Äù bagel sandwich and hot chocolate.  It seemed really busy when we arrived, but they are very organized, and had an employee directing traffic to ensure that things went smoothly.  Thanks so much to the entire staff!",None
73,Hailey Kallio,4,2023-06-06,"Great bagels and coffee!
Staff initially got our takeaway order mixed up, but we're very helpful and sorted things out quickly.

I have been to a couple St Viateurs in Montreal and they are always great.",None
74,Chun Loe,5,2023-06-06,"Overall, would recommend to everyone.

Got the traditionel and the joe bagel.

Service was friendly and efficient. There was a line up but did not have to wait longer than 10 minutes, which was great

Food was great. Traditional was smoked salmon, onions, capers and cream cheese. What's not the like. The joe was a good surprise, the fig jam   slaps :)",None

77,Rawad Elias,2,2018-07-07,"** Cash or Debit Only! **

Fresh bagels, generous portions, but expensive.  They need a better system to order and pay when it's busy.

Waited for 30 min because it was busy this morning.  When we reached the front of the line we were told that they ran out of bagel selection.  They only had Sesame bagels :(

Ordered the BLT (w salad +$3, and cheese +$2.50) and the Plateau bagel (w Turkey/let/tom/cheese) and the bill came up to $24.72!!

Since it was busy we decided to takeout our order, but they didn't cut the bagels for us so we were struggling in the park to cut our bagels with plastic knives :(

The fact that it's cash or debit ONLY doesn't make it convenient for customers.

Based on today's experience I wouldn't recommend it, but I might return to see if the other bagel selection is better.",None
78,Gurj Ghag,5,2023-02-06,This place was so good! Bagels were amazing. But Nick who had helped us was the cherry on top! He was so friendly and helpful. Even when they had accidentally got our order wrong he was quick to apologize sincerely and ensured that we were given fresh bagels and double checked the order! I will definitely be coming here every time I come to Montreal :)!,None

80,Isuru Vidanalage,5,2022-07-06,"Hands down best bagel I have ever tried!!!
As for the sandwiches, Vegetables are so fresh and meat is perfectly cooked. Love everything!
We tried few sandwiches and bought about 36 bagels.
Got lots of recommendations for this place when I ask about Montreal Bagels.
They have dine in option too.

Please be aware that there are two seperate lines for buying bagels only and buying sandwiches, drinks,..

No parking available. ( this is kinda expected given the location)
Highly recommend this place.",None
81,omahasc,5,2022-07-06,We had the Breakfast deluxe and a traditional.  Both were fantastic! The traditional offered a balance of flavors that made me want more. The breakfast deluxe with ham on am all dressed was great. Proceed with caution as the egg yoke will get a little messy but definitely worth the extra napkins.,None
82,Cherie Berk,5,2023-06-08,"Delicious bagels and great choices for fillings. We had the traditional sesame seed bagel with cream cheese, lox, onions and capers. Perfection",None
83,Richard Crane,1,2019-07-07,First experience having an authentic Montreal style bagel and I must say it was thoroughly disappointing. I had the sea salt and rosemary bagel and my partner had the all dressed bagel. The menu showed bagels for $1 however when you order with butter the price increases to $3.50 which is a lot to pay for a few pats of packaged butter. The bagels were extremely dry and overcooked and had little to no flavour. Our hot drinks were ok but the service was lackluster compared to other establishments we have visited in Montreal. Won't be going back here.,None

85,Bowen Lu,4,2018-07-07,"Great food! Very fast and friendly service, salmon bagel and plateau bagel were both delicious. Just a bit on the pricy side (9$ and 7$ without soup or salad)

Plain bagels are amazing and freshly made. Must visit if you're a tourist in Montreal!

Would totally go back!",None
86,Y L,5,2018-07-07,I love Montr√©al bagel! Their bagels are delicious and their cream cheese is super fluffy and creamy at the same time. The salmon in the traditional sandwich is very fresh and tasty. I always come here when I am visiting Montr√©al.,None
87,Ikhlas Hussain,5,2022-08-10,"The bagels at St-Viateur were out of this world! Crispy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside.
The wait was long and the sun was hot, but the food was worth it.
I had a traditionelle which had smoked salmon, capers, onions, and tomatoes. It was so good! The service was quick; our bagels were out within 5 minutes of ordering.
St- Viateur makes their own bagels and we got to see the bakers rolling and boiling the bagels in the back, which added to the fun.
Will definitely be back if we visit Montreal again.",None

The line goes very quickly as people are paying in cash only and are quick.  There‚Äôs always a bagel flavour that‚Äôs being baked so make sure to ask for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs hot?‚Äù bagels.

We tried the sesame, rosemary, cinnamon and plain.  They were all delicious!!!  Especially the hot sesame bagels.

Both were quite good, but I think the bagels by themselves are better. Or with just cream cheese.

The place was very crowded so we decided to take our order to go. We ordered our food, and waited, then after a 10min wait, we were told we had to order at another place.

The cashier was rolling her eyes while we ordered, and we were ordering together but she asked us to order separately (apparently too confusing for her) and sighing and rudely instructed us to go wait near the fridges after giving us the wrong bill, and she was bothered when I asked for the right bill.

I had asked for no cheese in my bagel (which was indicated on the bill) and noticed the staff preparing my bagel had put in cheese, they ignored me while I was asking them to please remove it. Then said it didn‚Äôt say anywhere no cheese, so I showed them the bill and they said  they didn‚Äôt have that information.

I asked them to please cut our bagels in half, since we were taking them to go, they huffed and puffed and ended up doing it.

176,O W,2,2019-07-07,"I had my brunch there today, I ordered the Classic ( Bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, Onion slices, Tomato and capers) with Tuna salad ( Caned Tuna, with diced celery, ball-peppers, 1 leaf of lettuce and a slice of tomato). My opinion is:

For the bagel Sandwich
1-The smoked Salmon is tasteless ( need more seasoning while curing)
2- the bagel over toasted.

For the Tuna Salad:
1- The salad over all was tasteless (again)
2-No dressing
3- It is canned.
4-The ratio between tuna and vegetables was a disaster (90% tuna - 10% celery, bell peppers and ONE leaf of lettuce).

For the service:
1- The order came fast
2- The waiters are not trained enough to give the customers a good experience.

For the interior and exterior:
1- The design is beautiful
2- Cleanliness is good
3- Location is accessible easily.

In general
1- Price to portion is good.

I had a sesame bagel and my wife had a rosemary and salts and both were great. We had the omerta and the traditional. The omerta is a combination of different deli meat, while the traditional is composed by Salmon and onions. Both were full of taste and rich. You can have the bagel with soup or salad. Black coffee is bottomless. The best part is that they ship bagel to anywhere in Canada and US. I would definitely ship them a dozen because they were amazing. The server was very friendly and she always had a smile on her face.

The service is standard, I think they're friendly, and given the popularity of this place and how busy it can get they do a great job.

306,Jack Dawson,1,2022-07-06,"This was our first visit to Montr√©al. Visiting St Viateur was recommended online, so we decided to go here.
There was a long line-up outside the store, one of the store employees (very nice older man) asked us if we wanted to purchase bagels or sandwiches, we only wanted to get 1 dozen bagels, so he took us out of the line and straight to the cashier for purchase.
He helped us choose the right bagels, all the while smiling and providing good service.
Then he asked us if we wanted coffee so we said yes, so he went to get us coffee. In the meantime, an older Chinese man, who was charging our credit card, spoke rudely to us, saying something in French, he also yelled at the good older gentleman who went to get our coffee.
Then the manager of the store came over, then the Chinese man also complained to the manager pointing out to the nice old man.
Then the manager looked at the nice old man with anger, went to him, and we could tell by the body language that the older man was being reprimanded.
We apologized to the older man if we accidentally got him in trouble, he smiled and walked away.
We paid and since there were many places to sit within the store, we decided to sit down, to have our coffee and bagel. The manager followed us and told us bluntly that we could not sit and that we had to leave the store. We told him we will finish our coffee and leave, I was not feeling well that day. He said that the seating areas are for other customers and that we should hurry up and leave.
Low and behold, we hurried up and ate our bagel, drank 2 sips of coffee and rushed, the manager was staring at us giving us dirty looks.
We rushed and left the store.
We felt very insulted, disgusted and ill-treated. We did not expect such horrible service.
This experience destroyed our whole trip. The manager did not even apologize for his rudeness. We feel sorry for the good old man.
Terrible service. The manager made us feel like second class citizen. He made us feel discriminated. Stay away from this St Viateur Mont Royal location!!!!",None

Of course the bagels are still the main attraction and terrific as always.  But what's changed is their coffee shop.  They used to serve delicious,  and hearty plates of bagel sandwiches of all sorts with great, freshly prepared salads on the side.  The variety was fantastic from lux to roast beef, and even vegetarian options.  Sadly when we went the last time a few weeks ago, there was no service. Instead of plates we were given bagels in paper boxes, and salads in prepackaged containers.   Just aweful üôÅ. Not sure why they even had tables when there was no service!

Worst of all is we did not receive a single clean utensil. It was so disgusting we didn't even drink our coffees because we didn't know if the cups were clean.

We went over to Fairmont bagels right after here to get some bagels to take back. I feel like this is the better of the two places.",None
389,r F,5,2022-07-06,Quaint resto caf√© bakery located in the hub of the plateau district which offers up Montreal's best bagel. From your smoked salmon and cream cheese to breakfast bagels with bacon and eggs  inside . Great coffee and a fun streetview of the vibrant plateau life. Be sure to leave with a bag of fresh hot steamy chewy bagels !,None
390,Janice Law,5,2019-07-07,"Down to earth service and good quality food at reasonable price. We went there twice in the same trip. Ordered Breakfast Sandwich Bagel with the Salad of the Day (Sweet Potato) and a Montreal Smoke Meat Bagel with the soup of the day (Chicken soup with Ozo and spinach ). Large portion at $15/ $17. Drinks were relatively pricey when compared to food. A lot of food for two ladies, luckily we were very hungry. Went back again for smoke salmon bagel. This time we were not as hungry. So we only ordered one ""meal"" (bagel with side salad/ soup) and an extra bagel with cream cheese. Perfect amount of food this time. Recommend this for travellers who doesn't have a fridge and can't take leftover back to hotel.",None

393,Melisa T.,1,2019-07-07,"Worst service that I ever experienced. There are two menus, a smaller one with only basic bagels, that everyone can get very cheap in a supermarket along with a glass of nutella. The other one is much bigger and has these delicious-looking bagels on it with lots of toppings and even a salad on the side (see pictures on google). We only got the small one and were very disappointed in the selection. After asking, the very rude and arrogant server told us that we got the small menu because we were there before 10am. Other tables around us had the large menu though (it was still before 10am) and even when we entered the store there was a family already eating the bagels from the large menu. I don't know based on what criteria they decide who gets which menu, but I am very disappointed!!",None

395,Some Random Canuck,4,2017-07-07,"It's incredible to see the explosion St-Viateur is having with new locations now found around this city these last few years. This new location is pretty much what I always hoped for. You can have the excellent bagels that you can get from this franchise but now they prepare them for you on the spot so you can eat it there any way you practically want! This is a very welcomed innovation.

The bagels are made on the spot... so fresh and warm.... the old Montreal bagel style everyone should try out at least once in their lifetime.

The menu is pretty vast considering the amount of ways you can have your bagel prepared. Specialty bagels comes with sides of either soup or salad. Many varieties are given.

I went with their BLT bagel and crab salad. Minus a mark for not having any soup available but... it was after all 8 PM. The crab salad was really good so it made up for this shortcoming. The BLT sandwich was excellent as well. I enjoyed my food!

The service was very nice and efficient. No issues there as well.

I did find the price tag to a bit higher since the sesame bagel by itself is sold for under a dollar but you get all the thrills with your bagel and you know what.... sometimes you have to splurge and go all out.

Good times.",None

Nowadays you can get a credit card terminal everywhere. All other restaurants offer card payment but this incompetent management decided not to! As a tourist it‚Äôs expensive and unpractical to carry cash. I consider the plateau as one of the tourist areas in Montreal where tourist should be welcomed to pay conveniently.

My family ordered fruit, beverages, simple bagels with cc and butter. The butter was not rec'd. I had to go ask for butter and was told they'd bring it to me. So I sat back down and waited. When the 3 small tubs of butter were rec'd there was no apology. The bagels were not warm so the butter wasn't melting. I needed more napkins for my table but Kristen never came over to ask if everything was okay. My daughter had to go ask for the bill after we just sat there too long after we'd finished our mediocre breakfast. I guess my expectations were too high and I assumed that customers would be valued...especially tourists. All the time sitting there I kept wishing another employee was my server...a nice woman who interacted with everyone she encountered...and not the woman with the tattoos on her arms and legs that greeted people at the door.

then generously I say sorry and give around $ 1.60  after that come and told,  - excuse me ?  is not enough ,  your bill was $ 30 include taxes,  my tip should be that amount minus taxes = 15% .  I'm absolutely shocked !!!  what a shame him only serviced 2 bagels to 2 people,  we had to up and pay in cash on till and him request more tip ?? .. always leave tip more than when pay by card,  but that was absolutely disgusting.  back to him saying is unbelieved,  sorry no more cash if you want the rest of the tip accept a card and pay yours $ 1.00 remained, the conversation stop there and left !!!

493,Rachel Fraser,3,2018-07-07,"Very surprised by this place. The bagels were good, but I ordered a smoked salmon bagel. It arrived with cream cheese and smoked salmon, that's it. Very odd. Every place I ever had a a smoked salmon bagel, from the UK, GTA, Niagara & Northern Ontario it has always come with at least red onions or capers or both. None of these were included, nor offered. I approached the cash to pay, where the server directed me and noticed they were making up many smoked salmon bagels which featured both capers and red onion. They had lots of this topping behind the prep station and even had other things such as tomato, cucumber and even black olives. I'm not sure why they wouldn't offer these common toppings to my breakfast, or even suggest the idea when I order, as they didn't seem that busy
But that maybe just how they treat out-of-towners. Eh, what can you do?",None
