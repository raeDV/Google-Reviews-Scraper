29,Artin Azizian,4,2023-06-06,Good selection of rides. Foods and beverages are overpriced as every other amusement park. Although some rides are under maintenance so you might not be able to enjoy them. It can get too crowded which gives you less time to enjoy the rides but you can probably dodge that by going early or late. Mid-day is the most crowded.,Thank you for the review.
