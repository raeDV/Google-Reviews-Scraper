1,Skylar Massicotte,5,2023-06-22,Was a 5 year student here and despite getting in situations with particular teachers the school is a great school! The staff are professional and understanding as well as the student programs diverse and set! I will never forget my student years at Vanier college thank you for the great memories üë®üèª‚Äçüéìüéâ ‚Ä¶,None
2,Lawrence Kelly,1,2023-03-08,"Disappointing. Tried to register for courses at this school.  Could not get any assistance or direction by phone, email, or chat. Attempted multiple times.  Very strange that they had no interest in new students. Appeared like I was a chore, no one wanted to deal with.  Simplest of questions were unable to be answered by anyone. Consistently brushed off.  Very odd behaviour for a school. Obviously they have too many students already.",None
3,Tina Bao-Han Nguyen,5,2023-04-07,"The college was very clean and organized. I love the environment at Vanier. The library was huge. I went to the library often to study there; it was incredible. I saw many students studying at the library and also they were very loud over there. One of the professors at Vanier told them to be quiet so that others can concentrate on their work. One of the counselors at Vanier was very friendly to help me to grow my potential. Overall, I enjoy attending Vanier College to study at the library. Hopefully, Vanier is the right college for me and would like to get my DEC over there. Wish me luck in my future!",None
4,Alex Sylvester,4,2019-07-07,"As an istitution it's great! Provides above the basics but can be better in a lot of services. However, I have met a lot of people and it's a great place to learn at. The library has been recently renovated and it's amazing!",None
5,ErisWhistles,3,2023-02-06,"Some teachers are excellent some teachers are awful in computer science.

The Access Center and Student services are good and offer a lot of nice help.

Biggest issue. parking. Students outnumber teachers by nearly 15 to 1. They closed the parking behind the park, they are monitoring parking more frequently I got a 68$ ticket for being in a free parking zone by the metro because the fee is 9$ a day at school parking if you are lucky to even get one. 6000 students in Vanier and maybe 100 spots for students.",None
6,ND Tung,3,2023-02-06,"So far, it's a decent college in general. But the course registration system is truly a mess. I have to take a mountain biking for my PE course, which I don't know bike but it is the only available PE course that fit my schedule. Even the preference course change days come and my only option is mountain biking. Asked the academic advisor to help me find another course, ""Take it or delete it, I have a lot of work to do."" Imagine paying forcing a student to pay thousands for tuition and $260 for a course which he doesn't want to take but have no other choice. Now I have to do PE in summer course. This school really know how to exploit students' money.",None
7,maryam farokhmehr,5,2021-07-06,"This college is one of the two English language colleges in Montreal they are respectful and the admission office is very very kind and helpful they try to tell you and guide you through all the admission steps you can also go to the campus and check the every Department computer science department department has around 3 or 4 computer Laboratories but today that I was there there was almost nobody there the professor is also staying at home they don't come to college so it looks like a graveyard. Silent and secluded. üòÜüòÖ
The campus is very nice and sweet. The bulding looks very old. But they have renovated them. The programs that are offered here in IT are general and not really specific.",None
8,Amani Unknown,1,2023-03-08,"I went to the academic advising office today to get help about either cancelling a class or changing it, the guy (Marco) was not helpful at all, did not let me speak, and told me to hurry up to make my decisions and was super rude. He seemed like he didn‚Äôt even know what he was talking about and basically told me to ¬´ shut up ¬ª and make my decision. I left the office crying, and told the receptionist about it, which she responded with ¬´ Okay ¬ª. They pretend like they care but the staff is not professional and human at all. What an awful experience for a department that‚Äôs supposed to listen and help students.",None
9,Alex Vanier,1,2023-04-07,Terrible school. All they care about is money and not about the quality of the education or teachers. They hire anyone with lack of experience and dont know how to teach at all!,None
10,Keywan Hodaei Esfahani,3,2022-12-08,I go to Vanier for kids swimming lessons. This place is relatively clean. The swim instructors are capable and friendly. I have also played basketball here as part of a friendly tournament. Staff are friendly. The downside is lack of free parking.,None

18,Bella Amari,1,2022-07-06,"Teachers were incredible but the continuing education center had no sympathy for those with disabilities or who are mentally ill.

I'd be chastised in the office in front of my peers for going to necessary medical appointments- appointments that could only be given during weekdays, as they were publicly funded. I was denied going to certain appointments, even if teachers OK'd it. I was told by the office that  they'd ensure I would lose the very funding that kept me afloat. I'd be told things like ""Well I have anxiety and I don't miss my obligations"" by the dean, a man who probably earned more than enough to afford having privately paid appointments outside of his working hours.

Even if the teachers are supportive , willing to make work-arounds, and helpful, the people running the programs are heartless. There is no room for anyone with any sort of struggle, they just want you to finish your program so they can get their money's worth.",None
19,Yann Mack,4,2022-07-06,"College facilities are modern and clean; equipment is regularly updated/upgraded. I've had a great experience with both students and teachers in Computer Engineering. My only complaint is that the administration has been out of touch with student needs/worries throughout the entirety of the pandemic; blindly following the whim of politicians instead of legitimately trying to help all students by developing a long-term, safe, and functional hybrid online solution as would be expected of a modern educational facility.",None

24,Kylin Zhang,1,2022-07-06,"It‚Äôs a terrible college, they do not give support for their students, student services helpers are rude. They push all the faults on you rather than taking their responsibility. Personally I‚Äôm depressed since I‚Äôm getting into this college, it is the worst school in Montreal. Therefore. I suggest any students that would like to go to c√©gep apply Dawson or Marianapolis, those are very good colleges that give lots of support.",None
25,Jo M,5,2018-07-07,"Great college. In a good location. Seems like a reputed college. Enthusiastic sports teams.

26,kirsten marie erskine,1,2021-07-06,"I've applied for a program multiple times over the years. I have 10+ years experience in said field but will not accept me based on marks I've received 10+  years ago. During that semester, my grandmother passed away and I had been refused for a program transfer so I had completely given up. I'm now 30 and still face those consequences.

29,mirelle aldbai,2,2020-07-06,"Dear vanier,
I appreciate how much parking area you have. However, it is not enough for students who start classes later or who get stuck in traffic. This past week i almost had my car towed for parking it in the parking area albeit not in an actual parking spot. There is not enough space for most students and it's a bit far from the metro.
The college is big which is good but on the other hand, there's a big courtyard in between the main building and the N building so we have to walk alot especially in the snow it' not a good idea.
So, i suggest to build an underground passageway between the buildings.
Thank you for taking into consideration my request :)",None

31,Jeffery Monaco,2,2018-07-07,"I attended many years ago as a student of the creative arts department. Not only was I treated indifferently by the intelligentsia of the departments, but the college staff were not teachers. They pushed their personal agendas instead of an environment of free thinking and support for the creative process. Not one teacher helped me to develop myself into a free thinking individual, if you did not toe the line and be cool, you were outcast. No wonder these department are no longer functioning. Should have gone elsewhere.",None
32,Fr Boucher,2,2019-07-07,"UPDATE :
After an other call to Vanier's financail services 8 days ago and promises that it will be done, the refund is still in the system and I am waiting.... This place goes down to 2 stars.
___________________________________________

I could not agree more with the numerous comments about poor administration. It's unfortunate. I was at first impressed with the quality of the program I have been admitted to. And, people are nice. It is with a little twinge that I withdrew to attend a college much closer to my home.

I was told that the refund for some of the academic fees would be issued within 4 to 6 weeks, which is somewhat long nowadays. Anyway... more than 2 months have gone and I am still waiting for this refund after a few emails and calls. They are expecting me to be patient... How can it be so complicated to issue a refund of 115$? Incompetence, negligence, leave of absence of the accounts payables staff, recklessness?

Administration should support the mission of an organization. If these ""small things"" are not appropriately and promptly attended to,  it can truly become annoying.

It will not get more than 3 stars.",None
33,Mirela SA,2,2018-07-07,"I started school here in Fall 2016 and it's been a disaster from there. There is always something with the administration, whether it be the course registration, course change, delays with summer school, etc.

I was in the nursing program for a semester and it was horrible. Some of their nursing teachers should not be teaching and their program is horrible (no wonder majority fail). It is disorganized. They need a serious fix with their program. Or start from fresh.

Academic advising is not very helpful most of the time which is why I always go to Rita instead.

Good luck if you have classes in D-5. And in the N building (which, btw why is it outside?)

I regret choosing Vanier.",None
