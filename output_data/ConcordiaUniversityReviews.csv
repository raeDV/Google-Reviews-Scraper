1,1,As a student in the early 2000’s this was a great place to study. As a recent employee, my experience was terrible. I worked for the faculty of engineering and the people they have managing the staff are pathetic. They like to throw around all the buzz words that make it seem like they care about staff but they’re two-faced, shameless liars. The union is useless- they say « we know the management is underhanded but there’s nothing we can do » and the Academics in charge couldn’t care less. Worst management I’ve seen in my extensive experience in the workforce. My advice is: don’t leave a job to work in the engineering department.,JE Jean,2023-01-25
2,5,Great uni! Great profs (not all of them as in every uni), great opportunities. Still a young university but has a lot of potential and can compete with the best unis in Canada in several fields (business, cs etc…).,Et si,2023-04-28
3,1,Coming from mcgill …. Concordia has no advisor… they say they do but they are impossible to reach and once you reach them they refer you to the online systems…… and are of no help  They barely have online courses…I took one 1.5 credit online this summer but has a mandatory 1 h per week in class…. So I have to drive 300km for that 1 h period every week.   ….. they would need to redefine online…  No help whatsoever for students and they are impossible to reason!,A,2023-05-10
4,2,People deserve to know about how leftist radicals and conservative extremists are mishandling our public schools (Student union rigged elections, Marxism, fascism, Satanism through the Freemasons and Illuminati) Centrism could boost this 2-3 star school to a 4 or 5 star as the hidden curriculum within caused by corruption is hurting a lot of students. You could thug through in less politicized programs such as engineering but the point is that all programs should be under strict reform and ready to adapt international norms regarding Centrism like Russia, that is excelling at mixing science and religion together validly. Take for instance the political line. Since it takes into account all logic, therefore Centrism is part of that in the center and has validity as well as a lot of value and divine knowledge.,Valiri Saati,2023-01-23
