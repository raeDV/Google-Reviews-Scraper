2,5,The park is beautiful, has a great space for barbecue and various physical activities.  It has a sand court for volleyball and footvolley.  It has tennis courts, good space for running and walking both in the surroundings and in the middle of the park.  It has a beautiful artificial lake, it is well wooded.  In winter there is an ice skating rink.  On summer weekends it gets crowded, so if you plan on doing an activity, arrive early to choose the place.,Lorena Haack,2023-05-08
