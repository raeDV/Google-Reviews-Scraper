2,5,One of the very comfortable parks as far as barbecuing is concerned. With its large green areas, it is also more than suitable for children to play. Clean, spacious and well maintained. I would recommend everyone to barbecue there at least once.,Ghassan Al-Sumaidaee,2022-08-30
3,5,Taking a walk in the park is good for the soul. This place is magical. The wonders of nature right in the middle of the city. So grateful!,Dianne Goudreau,2022-10-31
4,5,great place to mellow out,Trevor Turple,2023-06-05
5,5,Amazing parc for a walk or biking or simply hanging  out. It is jam packed at times and the whole place coming alive with people with picnic, BBQ and all kinds of other activities. The small walking paths away from the crowd provides a peaceful break and a hiding spot from the sun. Watch out it is easy to lose sense of direction in here so keep an eye on the parc signs.,Rudra,2021-08-02
